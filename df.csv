Donald Trump joins TikTok after reversal on app he tried to ban as president,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-joins-tiktok-reversal/,"While in office, Trump took issue with the social media app being controlled by a China-based parent company, trying unsuccessfully to ban the app in the U.S. with an executive order.","Washington — Former President Donald Trump has joined TikTok, posting for the first time Saturday on the widely popular video-sharing app controlled by a Chinese parent company that he once tried to ban in the U.S. ""It's my honor,"" Trump said in the video, which features Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White, who declared that ""the president is now on TikTok."" The video, which had garnered more than 2 million likes by Sunday afternoon, features clips from Trump's attendance at the UFC match in Newark, New Jersey, on Saturday, where he was greeted by supporters after being convicted in the New York ""hush money"" trial on all 34 felony counts days earlier. While in office, Trump took issue with the social media app being controlled by a China-based parent company, trying unsuccessfully to ban the app in the U.S. with an executive order. Earlier this year, a renewed push against the app gained momentum in Congress, as lawmakers approved a foreign aid package that included a provision that required its sale within a year or a ban from U.S. app stores. But before Congress approved and President Biden signed the legislation that could lead to a ban on TikTok into law, Trump changed his tune. He argued that banning TikTok would benefit Facebook, which he called the ""true Enemy of the People."" Trump's super PAC joined TikTok last month, despite his previous views. At the time, Taylor Budowich, the CEO of MAGA Inc., said in a post on X that ""we will ensure President Trump's America First agenda is brought to every corner of the internet and every precinct of this country."" The development comes months after Mr. Biden's reelection campaign launched its own account on TikTok, despite his administration's support for the legislation that could lead to a ban. For both campaigns, the app presents an opportunity to reach young voters, who will be a key demographic in November's election.

Trump's guilty verdict: A stress test for democracy,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trumps-guilty-verdict-a-stress-test-for-democracy/,"Being found guilty of 34 felony counts would normally mark the end of someone's political prospects. But this week's conviction is not stopping Trump (who has built his career, and brand, on grievances) from running for another term in the White House.","Historic … unprecedented … and guilty. You couldn't escape those words this past week, after a former President of the United States was convicted on 34 felony counts in New York, a city he long called home. But beyond all the drama, said CBS News legal contributor Rebecca Roiphe, was simply a jury of seven men and five women doing their duty – and honoring the dictum, ""Nobody is above the law."" ""You can have all sorts of power, you can have all sorts of wealth, but when you're in that courtroom, you're just like anybody else,"" said Roiphe. ""Of course, there are some people who are going to look at this case and not look at it that way."" Donald Trump is one of them. ""It was a rigged trial,"" he claimed a day after he was found guilty. ""We wanted a venue change where we could have a fair trial. We didn't get it."" President Joe Biden, meanwhile, defended the legal system. ""The jury heard five weeks of evidence,"" he said Friday. ""They found Donald Trump guilty on all 34 felony counts. Now he'll be given the opportunity – as he should – to appeal that decision."" The gravity of this moment is obvious – a stress test for democracy, just as the Trump-Biden race is heating up. Less obvious is what happens next. For example, can a convicted felon still serve as president? ""Yes,"" said Roiphe. ""We have certain limitations [in the Constitution] on the presidency, and that is not one of them. ... There's nothing barring somebody from either running for the presidency, or for being president, as a convicted felon."" Trump is scheduled to be sentenced on July 11, days before Republicans are set to nominate him again. Trump attorney Todd Blanche admits it's possible his client could be in jail while the Republican National Convention is being held: ""That's something that I don't want to think about,"" he said Friday. ""I don't think it's going to happen. But it's possible, of course."" Regardless, the summer – with its debates, conventions, and other political fireworks – is likely to be a season of Trump's grievance. Trump's campaign says it raised more than $50 million 24 hours after the guilty verdict. And Trump has kept top Republicans at his side (some showing up in court, in loyal red ties) at his side. Author Michael Wolff covered the trial, and has written several books on Trump. ""This is a campaign, and this is a political career based on conflict, conflict, conflict, conflict,"" said Wolff. ""Other politicians are going to go running away from conflict. He's running absolutely toward it. ""The fact that this person keeps going against these things that no one could shoulder, somehow – weirdly – makes him heroic to many, many, many, many people,"" Wolff said. For Wolff, this crossroads is a reckoning of Trump – and of the combative New York world of infamous lawyers and fixers, hush money, and tabloids Trump has now made our own. Costa asked Wolff, ""As a longtime observer and writer on Trump, what do you make of him, someone who forged his career in the '70s and '80s alongside a New York lawyer like Roy Cohn, now finding himself a convicted felon in Lower Manhattan?"" ""I mean, it almost is poetic,"" Wolff replied. ""If you were a writer and you were writing this story, this is how you might have it end. The anomaly is that this is not necessarily where it ends, that it may well end in the White House."" For more info: Story produced by David Rothman. Editor: Chad Cardin.

Views of Trump trial unchanged following verdict — CBS News poll,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-verdict-new-york-poll/,"Half the country says Trump is not fit to be president; Republicans call the trial unfair, according to CBS News poll.","Views about former President Donald Trump's New York criminal trial after the verdict look much like they did before it took place. Just over half the country thought Trump was guilty before the verdict, and now just over half think the jury reached the right verdict and that the trial was fair. Republicans remain overwhelmingly of the belief that Trump was treated unfairly. Echoing the former president's sentiments, those who say the verdict was wrong call the jury biased, say the evidence was insufficient and the charges politically motivated. And in another marker of the nation's partisan divisions, half the country thinks Trump is unfit to be president now that he's been convicted of a crime. In all, we recontacted the Americans we interviewed before the verdict was reached, and hearing the jury's decision hasn't changed a lot of their minds. There are some implications for views of the U.S. justice system as a whole. Most Democrats say it's made them more confident in the justice system. Among Republicans, three quarters say it's made them less confident in it. Overall, opinions of the verdict are in line with what views of Trump's guilt or innocence were before the verdict was reached. Among those who thought Trump was guilty before hearing the verdict, nine in 10 now say the jury reached the right verdict — and vice versa for those who previously thought he wasn't guilty. In all, the verdict doesn't elicit any one widespread emotion from the country. Democrats feel mostly glad and relieved, but not many say they're hopeful. Republicans are more disappointed than angry, but not particularly surprised. (Respondents could express multiple feelings.) Most Republicans don't think Trump was convicted of serious crimes in this case. Among those who feel the jury reached the wrong verdict, six in 10 say the crimes are ""not at all serious."" And they by and large feel Trump was treated worse than most other criminal defendants. There's also disagreement on what punishment fits the crime, if any. Most Americans do not say Trump should serve time in prison for his conviction, but views here are also very partisan. In keeping with their view that the verdict was wrong, rank-and-file Republicans generally want the party to be loyal to Trump. We've seen this desire for loyalty expressed across many previous issues and also during the primary season. While opinion did not shift much in the immediate aftermath of the verdict, there's certainly some room for movement — especially among those who haven't been paying close attention. Those who have paid the most attention to the trial hold the firmest beliefs about it. Among those who hadn't heard much about the trial pre-verdict, most say they're still not following it very closely. This CBS News/YouGov survey is based on a nationally representative sample of 989 U.S. adults who were recontacted on May 30-June 1, 2024, after the conclusion of Donald Trump's criminal trial in New York City, following an initial survey of 1,402 adults conducted on May 14-21, 2024, before a verdict was reached.

"Fact checking Trump's remarks after historic conviction in ""hush money"" trial",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fact-check-trump-conviction/,CBS News fact checked four misleading claims Trump made about his trial in remarks he made Friday morning.,"Former President Donald Trump's Manhattan criminal trial concluded Thursday with a historic conviction, and in remarks in New York Friday morning, Trump continued to repeat false or misleading claims that framed the legal verdict as a partisan political attack. CBS News fact checked four of Trump's claims about his trial on Friday morning. Former President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed President Biden was behind the criminal trial in Manhattan: ""They are in total conjunction with the White House and the DOJ, just so you understand,"" Trump said Friday morning a day after his conviction. ""This is all done by Biden and his people."" This claim is false. Mr. Biden had no direct influence or power over the attorneys or the judge involved in this case. Further, the case was not brought by the U.S. Department of Justice. It was brought by the Manhattan district attorney's office. The trial did not take place in federal court, but rather within the court system in New York. On Friday, Trump said he is still under a gag order from Justice Juan Merchan, echoing what his lawyer, Todd Blanche, said on Fox News Thursday. CBS News legal contributor Jessica Levinson said Merchan hadn't yet lifted the gag order, as of Friday, the day after Trump's conviction. Separately, Reuters reported he ""will likely lift"" the order. Merchan gag order originally only prohibited Trump from speaking about witnesses and court staff, but it was expanded  April 1 to prohibit Trump from speaking about Bragg's family and Merchan's family after Trump repeatedly invoked Justice Merchan's daughter on social media. Merchan said the order was necessary because some of Trump's rhetoric might keep jurors, lawyers and court employees from performing their duties in the court. Trump is allowed to criticize Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and Merchan. The former president can also speak on the specifics of the case that he finds fault with or claim the entire trial is political if he wishes. So far, Trump has violated his gag order 10 times, and was fined a total of $10,000. Trump attacked the impartiality of Judge Merchan, who oversaw the case, calling him ""conflicted"" at least seven times on Friday. Previously, he also claimed Merchan's daughter worked with top Democrats. This is an exaggeration by Trump. Justice Merchan, who was randomly assigned to this case, made $35 in political contributions to Democrats through ActBlue in 2020, including $15 to Mr. Biden's campaign. Loren Merchan, the judge's daughter, has worked with some top Democrats through her role at a marketing company called Authentic Campaigns. In 2023, Merchan asked the New York Advisory Committee on Judicial Ethics to decide whether this amounted to a conflict. The panel issued a caution to Merchan because political contributions of any kind are prohibited under state judicial ethics rules. But they ruled Merchan's ability to do his job was not impacted. Merchan therefore denied Trump's request that he recuse himself — a decision which separate panel of judges from the New York Appellate Division recently upheld. Trump has repeatedly attacked Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who brought the ""hush money"" case to trial. During his remarks Friday, Trump claimed that Bragg did not intend to pursue a case against him until after he'd announced his election. This claim is false. Alvin Bragg took office in January of 2022 and inherited the case from a previous prosecutor, Cyrus Vance Jr. The New York Times reported that Bragg was confident by the summer of 2022 that he was moving forward with an indictment and that he could convince a court that felony charges for falsifying business records in this case were warranted. It wasn't until the fall of 2022 that Trump announced he was running again. Bragg has repeatedly been a target of Trump before and during the trial. CBS News found Trump made or amplified this claim that billionaire investor George Soros donated to Alvin Bragg at least 54 times on Truth Social, including the day the verdict came in when Trump called Bragg ""Soros-backed"" in a post. While it is true that Soros donated $1 million in May 2021 to a progressive racial justice group called Color of Change, and the political arm of the group later endorsed Bragg, a spokesman for Soros told the New York Times that the two men had never met — nor had Soros given money directly to Bragg's campaign.

DNC files complaint alleging shady fundraising practices from RFK super PAC,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-super-pac-dnc-complaint-shady-fundraising/,The Democratic National Committee accuses the Kennedy-linked super PAC American Values 2024 of not properly disclosing loans and repayments to hide that the PAC's largest donor is a Trump supporter.,"The Democratic National Committee this week filed another complaint with the Federal Election Commission against Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s allied super PAC, accusing it of engaging in shady fundraising practices. The latest complaint accuses the Kennedy-linked super PAC, American Values 2024, of again not properly disclosing loans and loan repayments to Gavin De Becker, the owner of a private security firm hired by Kennedy, in an alleged attempt to exaggerate its fundraising success and hide that the PAC's largest donor, Timothy Mellon, is also a major supporter of former President Trump. ""Despite what AV24 may believe, the rules do apply to them. By continuing to inflate their fundraising numbers, and concealing the extent to which Timothy Mellon, Donald Trump's largest donor, is propping up RFK Jr.'s candidacy, they are not only misconstruing election laws, they are deceiving the public,"" DNC senior adviser Mary Beth Cahill said in a statement to CBS News on Thursday. In April, a pattern emerged after the PAC refunded $2 million to De Becker, according to financial filings, and this partial refund followed his initial $4 million contribution to the PAC in February. This isn't the first time the PAC made this move, according to FEC filings. In 2023, the super PAC received a significant financial injection from De Becker, totaling about $10 million. But by the year's end, $9.6 million of these funds were returned, according to financial filings. PAC financial filings label these transactions as ""contributions"" and ""refunds,"" but the DNC argues the transactions should be classified as loans. The super PAC has touted these transactions, despite refunding a major portion of it back to De Becker, saying they show that ""there is real electricity and a palpable desire for change."" The DNC alleges that these transactions are being used to cover up Mellon's substantial stake in the super PAC. Tony Lyons, co-founder of American Values 2024, told CBS News in a statement Thursday that the DNC's complaint is ""part of their concerted effort to silence and censor Bobby Kennedy, mislead the public about his views, his policies and his past."" ""We will answer this officially to the FEC,"" Lyons said. Some campaign finance experts find these transactions ""very unusual."" Craig Holman, the government affairs lobbyist for Public Citizen, said he's ""never seen anything like it."" According to Holman, if the PAC is deliberately arranging for an infusion of funds only to return them later, ""that is a loan, and if it's being declared as a contribution, that would be a violation of campaign finance law."" Holman called this a ""self-serving"" arrangement between Kennedy and De Becker. ""Kennedy creates a false image that there's a great deal of money backing him, and De Becker gets some money out of it,"" he added. Andrew Mayersohn, a researcher at OpenSecrets, a nonprofit that tracks and publishes data on campaign finance, said these unusual transactions make the Kennedy campaign look more viable when it appears that funding is pouring into his cause rather than being loaned. ""People do in fact use those individual contribution totals to evaluate how well the campaign is doing,"" Mayersohn said. This the third FEC complaint filed by the committee. The group first filed a complaint in February, alleging that the PAC violated federal law after it announced plans to aid Kennedy's signature-gathering efforts in the key battleground states of Georgia, Arizona and Michigan at the start of 2024, along with funding ballot access efforts for Kennedy in five other states. Kennedy's campaign announced in April it had secured ballot access in Michigan. A spokesperson for the Michigan Secretary of State's office confirmed that the Natural Law Party, a minor party with a spot on the state's ballot, nominated Kennedy at the party's convention, which would allow him  to skip the signature gathering process in the Great Lake State. ""We were not coordinating. If we were coordinating, that wouldn't have happened,"" said Larry Sharpe, director of national organizing at American Values 2024. ""We wanted to help out with signatures because we wanted to help the campaign, and we picked states where the law said it was OK."" The DNC told CBS News that it has not heard back from the FEC on any of its complaints. Allison Novelo is a 2024 campaign reporter for CBS News. ",CBSnews,US
Trump campaign says it raised $52.8 million after guilty verdict,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-fundraising-guilty-verdict-new-york-conviction/,"Former President Donald Trump's campaign and the GOP raised $52.8 million in the hours after Trump was convicted on 34 felony counts in his ""hush money"" trial.","Former President Donald Trump's campaign and the Republican Party raised $52.8 million in the 24 hours after Trump was convicted on 34 felony counts in his ""hush money"" trial, the campaign said Friday, a staggering total that represents more than half of what they raised in the entire month of April. The campaign said that Thursday's sum mostly came from small-dollar donors, including 30% who were new contributors to WinRed, the GOP's fundraising platform. Fundraising totals can't be verified until the campaign's reports to the Federal Election Commission are released next month. A CBS News analysis of the Trump campaign's fundraising through April found he has received an influx in donations following key moments in his legal battles. Before his conviction on Thursday, FEC filings show Trump's two best fundraising days were April 4, 2023, when he was arraigned in New York City, and Aug. 25, 2023, the day after his mugshot was released in his separate criminal case in Georgia. Trump's fundraising also spiked when he was indicted by federal grand juries in Florida in June 2023 and Washington, D.C., in August 2023. He likewise saw a bump when a different judge in New York ordered him to pay $454 million in fines and interest in his civil fraud case in February. Between his conviction in the ""hush money"" case and Friday afternoon, Trump's team spent at least $94,900 on ads on Facebook and Instagram — more than double what the campaign spent in the week leading up to the trial's conclusion, according to data from the Meta Ad Library. The ads paint Trump as a ""political prisoner,"" and say Thursday was a ""dark day in America."" ""I WAS JUST CONVICTED IN A RIGGED TRIAL,"" many of the ads begin. Trump railed against the trial as ""rigged"" and called the charges a ""scam"" in remarks at Trump Tower on Friday. The ads direct users to WinRed, a Republican fundraising site that crashed minutes after the verdict. The campaign said the technical failure was caused by the swell of traffic to the site. Trump's campaign and the Republican Party raised roughly $76 million in April, surpassing the monthly total brought in by President Biden and the Democratic Party for the first time in this election cycle. FEC filings show Democrats have more cash on hand, but an influx of donations following his conviction could help Trump catch up. Trump's ads in the wake of the verdict echo the theme of his rhetoric throughout the trial: that the charges against him were part of a politically motivated effort by Democrats to weaken his campaign. One of his most widely viewed ads prior to his conviction repeated the falsehood that the trial was spearheaded by the Biden administration, when in fact it was a state case prosecuted by the Manhattan district attorney. Trump has also rallied supporters by calling himself the victim of a political ""witch hunt,"" a phrase he's used in at least 382 posts on his platform Truth Social and in several social media ads. Trump is now doubling down on the narrative, urging those who visit his WinRed donation page to ""NEVER SURRENDER"" under a photo of the mugshot that previously helped him raise millions. For its part, the Biden campaign said Trump is ""unhinged"" and ""consumed by his own thirst for revenge and retribution"" after his remarks on Friday. The president himself addressed the verdict for the first time later in the day, saying at the White House that the verdict reaffirmed the ""American principle that no one is above the law.""

Biden addresses Trump verdict for first time,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-addresses-trump-verdict/,"President Biden said the ""American principle that no one is above the law was reaffirmed"" after Trump was convicted on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.","Washington — President Biden made his first public comments on the conviction of former President Donald Trump in a case relating to a ""hush money"" payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels, asserting that the ""American principle that no one is above the law was reaffirmed."" Speaking from the White House on Friday, Mr. Biden criticized his 2024 rival's response to the guilty verdict. Trump has claimed the trial was ""very unfair"" and ""rigged."" ""It's reckless, it's dangerous, it's irresponsible, for anyone to say this was 'rigged,' just because they don't like the verdict,"" Mr. Biden said. ""Our justice system has endured for nearly 250 years, and it literally is the cornerstone of America. Our justice system. The justice system should be respected. And we should never allow anyone to tear it down. It's as simple as that. That's America. That's who we are, and that's who we'll always be, God willing."" The New York jury reached a verdict Thursday, finding that Trump illegally falsified business records to conceal a $130,000 payment made in the days before the 2016 election to Daniels to silence her account of a sexual encounter with him. Trump has denied sleeping with Daniels. He was convicted on 34 felony counts. Mr. Biden noted that the charges were state charges, not federal charges, after Trump and his allies have falsely accused him and the Justice Department of orchestrating the trial. ""Now he will be given the opportunity, as he should, to appeal that decision, just like everyone else has that opportunity,"" Mr. Biden said. Trump, who is the first former president to be convicted of a crime, said Friday that he is ""going to fight"" and appeal the conviction.

"Trump, Biden debate will face obstacles in bypassing commission, co-chair predicts",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-biden-debate-obstacles-commission-presidential-debates/,"""There's a lot of questions"" about the debates that haven't been resolved, co-chair Frank Fahrenkopf said, adding, ""That could prevent it from happening.""","Two presidential debates have been announced — without the involvement of the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) — putting the CPD in a rare and potentially perilous void of irrelevance. Commission co-chairman Frank Fahrenkopf, a veteran of 33 presidential and vice presidential clashes, isn't convinced President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump will go through with debates announced for June 27 on CNN and Sept. 10 on ABC. CBS News has proposed a vice presidential debate that Kamala Harris has accepted. Trump, who does not yet have a running mate, has not accepted this debate yet. ""There are a lot of things that have to be worked out,"" Fahrenkopf told CBS News on this week's episode of ""The Takeout."" ""There's a lot of questions…that aren't to my knowledge worked out yet. That could prevent it from happening."" Fahrenkopf, who, outside of the Biden and Trump campaigns, is possibly the most interested observer of the debate schedule and machinations, listed some unresolved issues: drug tests (Trump said he will ""demand"" one of Biden); whether the candidates will be seated at a table or standing behind podiums; opening statements; length of response time/rebuttal; and commercial breaks (commission-sponsored debates were 90 uninterrupted minutes). Eager to share debate commission history, Fahrenkopf said disputes over issues like these came close to paralyzing debates before the commission was formed in 1987. ""That's the reason that we were created,"" Fahrenkopf said. ""The history of two campaigns sitting down and arguing and arguing and arguing. Remember — we went 16 years without debates. Little things can get in the way. I don't know whether that's as true here, but there are a lot of things."" The first televised presidential debate took place in 1960 at the Chicago studio of CBS News station WBBM and was moderated by CBS News anchor Howard K. Smith, along with a panel that included journalists from ABC and NBC News. It was a ratings sensation and campaign lore was that GOP nominee and then-Vice President Richard Nixon lost ground to the Democratic nominee, Massachusetts Sen. John F. Kennedy. After Kennedy's assassination in 1963, Lyndon Johnson declined to debate in 1964. Stung by his experience in 1960, Nixon refused to debate in 1968 and 1972. In 1976, President Gerald Ford, who succeeded Nixon after he resigned, agreed to debate Democratic nominee, former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter. The League of Women Voters sponsored debates that year and through 1984 when, following two academic studies recommending a non-partisan commission to oversee debates, the Commission on Presidential Debates was formed. Fahrenkopf, formerly chairman of the Republican National Committee, was an original founder, along with then-Democratic National Committee Chairman Paul Kirk. Though it's now landed in a new and uncomfortable political wilderness, Fahrenkopf said the commission is not dead — at least not yet. ""Absolutely not,"" Fahrenkopf said. ""We are right now organizing, completing our planning and so forth. We have to wait to see what happens. My gut tells me that we may have a future. We better stick around."" Fahrenkopf knows the commission is viewed as an anachronism and has absorbed withering criticism from both Trump — who accused the commission of being biased against Republicans — and close advisers to Mr. Biden who view commission procedures as outmoded and fussy. But Fahrenkopf withdrew his harshest criticism of top White House communications adviser Anita Dunn, when he told Politico's Deep Dive podcast that Dunn ""hates"" the commission and was the reason Mr. Biden's team went around it to negotiate with Trump's campaign. ""Yeah, maybe I spoke a little too roughly,"" Fahrenkopf told CBS News. ""She doesn't like us. Let's say that maybe I was a little too strong."" He conceded the commission's days could be numbered. ""We're hoping that we're going to know in the next few weeks whether things are really going to happen or not,"" Fahrenkopf said. Asked if the July 4th weekend could be a deadline for the commission to know whether it has a future in this election, Fahrenkopf said yes. ""If there's no commitment to the commission by July 4th, then probably this isn't going to happen."" Confronting that reality in ways he never has before, Fahrenkopf said something would be lost if debates fell to individual TV networks with smaller audiences. Commission debates have traditionally been carried by all networks without commercial breaks or glaring promotional overlays and constant haggling over format, moderators, locations and myriad other issues. This year, the cable and broadcast networks hosting the debates, CNN and ABC, have offered to allow all networks to simulcast the debates. ""I think it has become part of the tradition of how we elect the people who lead our country as president and vice president,"" Fahrenkopf said of commission debates. ""I would hate to see this also disappear."" Fahrenkopf was asked if he was rooting for the announced debates to fall apart. ""No, that's not true. I can't say that."" Fahrenkopf added, ""If they're able to succeed with these two debates that they're planning, if they're done right (and) they educate the American people, I will give them a salute. The only reason we exist is to make sure debates take place. However, he added, ""If they crash and burn, we'll still be there and hopefully be able to fill what's empty.""

RFK Jr. plans to file lawsuit against Nevada over ballot access,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-plans-to-file-lawsuit-against-nevada-over-ballot-access/,"In late March, the Nevada Secretary of State's Office acknowledged that a staffer wrongly informed Kennedy's campaign that it did not need to name a vice-presidential pick on its petition.","Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is planning to file a lawsuit against the Nevada Secretary of State's office, CBS News has learned, nearly two months after learning that his campaign would likely have to restart signature gathering in the Silver State. In early March, the campaign announced that it had collected more than 15,000 signatures in Nevada, but before Kennedy had named a running mate, which is required by state law to start the petition process for independent candidates. In late March, the Nevada Secretary of State's Office acknowledged, however, that a staffer wrongly informed the campaign that it did not need to name a vice-presidential pick on the petition. However, in a statement Thursday provided to CBS News, Nevada Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar said his office is prepared to face Kennedy in court, given that his campaign received guidance with the statutes made clear. ""Nevada has a rich history of independent and third party candidates for office. Each of those candidates managed to attain ballot access by following the law. We look forward to seeing Mr. Kennedy's team in court,"" Aguilar said. With over a month left to gather new signatures, the campaign will likely run out of time to start over in Nevada if it pursues litigation in court and loses the case. In a May 23 settlement letter written by Paul Rossi, the Kennedy campaign's lead ballot access attorney, he warned the secretary of state's office that Kennedy was prepared to file a lawsuit Friday unless the office agrees to settle with the campaign. Rossi offered to drop any charges and avoid litigation costs in exchange for the office validating the signatures. RFK Jr. plans to file lawsuit against Nevada over ballot access by Faris Tanyos on Scribd Rossi proposed circulating Nicole Shanahan's name in newspapers around the state to correct the omission of RFK Jr.'s running mate on the petition. Additionally, anyone who signed Kennedy's petition may withdraw their support if they choose to, Rossi offered. ""We are happy to discuss and iron out any details to reach an acceptable settlement of this unique factual circumstance,"" Rossi wrote. A similar case occurred in 2008, when the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority filed a petition with the secretary of state's office to put an education and infrastructure funding initiative on the ballot. The secretary of state's office determined that the petition was invalid because the form violated state guidelines, and that decision was later upheld by the Nevada Supreme Court. Kennedy was not the only independent candidate to learn he would have to start over in Nevada. Independent presidential candidate Cornel West submitted a new petition to the secretary of state's office in April, the same day he revealed his running mate, Melina Abdullah, a California-based pan-African studies professor, and leader of the California chapter of Black Lives Matter, according to the secretary of state's office. ""In early March, the Secretary of State's office sent guidance to all independent campaigns for president that had filed petitions for ballot access,"" Aguilar said in his statement to CBS News. ""This guidance highlighted the statutory requirements necessary for petitions to be valid. The guidance was sent well in advance of the deadline to submit signatures, which still has not passed.

Can Trump still vote after being convicted?,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-convicted-vote-florida/,Former President Trump was convicted of 34 felony counts in New York. Can he still vote in the presidential election?,"Former President Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee for the presidency in November, is now a convicted felon, but it's still likely he can vote — and vote for himself — in Florida this fall. Trump, whose primary residence was in New York for most of his life, moved his residency to Florida in 2019, so that's where he would seek to vote this fall. Trump can still become president as a convicted felon, and experts say despite his conviction on 34 felony counts on Thursday, he can likely vote, too. Trump's sentencing hearing is scheduled for July, but his attorneys are sure to file all appeals possible, and it's not yet clear whether he will serve prison time. Blair Bowie, an attorney at the Campaign Legal Center, said Florida ""defers to other state laws when it comes to disenfranchising voters who are tried and convicted elsewhere."" According to Florida state law, a Florida resident with a felony conviction elsewhere is only ineligible to vote ""if the conviction would make the person ineligible to vote in the state where the person was convicted,"" the Florida Division of Elections website says. According to the New York courts website, ""you lose your right to vote while you are in prison for a felony conviction."" But ""if you are convicted of a felony and you are released from prison, you can vote,"" and ""if you are convicted of a felony and your sentence is suspended, you can vote."" In a social media post Friday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis wrote that ""Trump hasn't lost his voting rights in Florida. Rights are not removed in Florida where they haven't yet been stripped in the convicting jurisdiction."" The ACLU of New York says convicted felons who are on parole, on probation, were not sentenced to prison or completed a prison sentence can vote. ""New York only disenfranchises people while serving a prison sentence, so assuming Trump is not sentenced to prison time, his rights would be restored by New York law and therefore also in Florida,"" Bowie said. CBS News legal analyst and Loyola University Law School professor Jessica Levinson agreed, saying a person convicted of a felony can vote unless incarcerated. ""New York says you can vote unless he's incarcerated, so no incarceration means he can vote,"" Levinson said. Trump is still facing charges related to alleged election interference in Georgia and Washington, D.C, and another 40 counts related to the classified documents case in Florida. None of those cases have trial dates set yet. Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital, based in Washington, D.C. ",CBSnews,US
"Biden campaign warns: ""Convicted felon or not,"" Trump could still be president",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-campaign-trump-trial-verdict/,"""There is still only one way to keep Donald Trump out of the Oval Office: at the ballot box,"" President Biden's campaign said.","Washington — The Biden campaign warned that former President Donald Trump's conviction in a ""hush money"" case doesn't prevent him from winning another term in the White House from a legal standpoint. ""There is still only one way to keep Donald Trump out of the Oval Office: at the ballot box. Convicted felon or not, Trump will be the Republican nominee for president,"" the campaign's communications director Michael Tyler said in a statement Thursday. Trump became the first former U.S. president to be convicted of a crime when a New York jury found he violated the law by falsifying business records to cover up a $130,000 payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. He was found guilty on all 34 counts. The Biden campaign said the verdict shows ""no one is above the law,"" but it also ""does not change the fact that the American people face a simple reality."" ""The threat Trump poses to our democracy has never been greater. He is running an increasingly unhinged campaign of revenge and retribution, pledging to be a dictator 'on day one' and calling for our Constitution to be 'terminated' so he can regain and keep power,"" the statement said. ""A second Trump term means chaos, ripping away Americans' freedoms and fomenting political violence — and the American people will reject it this November."" The Biden campaign is fundraising off the message, telling supporters that Trump's conviction could be a boon for the former president. ""Donald Trump's supporters are fired up and likely setting fundraising records for his campaign,"" a text message to supporters said. ""That's money he will use to try to get back into the White House to carry out his threats of revenge and retribution against his political opponents. So while the MAGA Right comes to the aid of Trump, Joe Biden — and those who care about democracy — need you."" President Biden has not yet commented on the verdict. ""We respect the rule of law, and have no additional comment,"" Ian Sams, a spokesperson for the White House counsel's office, said in a statement. Bo Erickson contributed reporting.

How Trump's conviction could change the dynamics of the 2024 race,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-convicted-2024-race-dynamics/,Former President Donald Trump has been found guilty of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in his Manhattan criminal trial.,"Former President Donald Trump has been found guilty of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in his Manhattan criminal trial, adding another layer of uncertainty to an already unprecedented campaign. As a convicted felon, Trump is not prevented from continuing to campaign for president, since the Constitution does not prohibit candidates from running for president even if they are convicted of a crime. In fact, there is precedent for a candidate running from behind bars: In 1920, Socialist Party candidate Eugene V. Debs ran for president from a federal penitentiary in Atlanta. Trump is the first former U.S. president to be found guilty of felonies, and the first major party candidate to run for office after being found guilty of a crime. Here's how his conviction could change the 2024 campaign: Now that he's convicted, Trump is all but certain to appeal the decision handed down by the jury, and he is likely to be able to return to the campaign trail as the process plays out. The next development in the case will come at sentencing, currently scheduled for July 11. Justice Juan Merchan has wide discretion over when sentencing occurs and what the punishment looks like. Trump faces a maximum of up to four years in prison and a $5,000 fine for each of the 34 felony charges of falsification of business records. The sentencing options available to Merchan include prison, probation, conditional discharge, fines or house arrest. The judge could put limitations on his travel, such as restricting Trump from leaving the state and taking his passport, but Merchan has said he doesn't want to interfere with his ability to campaign. ""I would think that the judge wouldn't dare interfere with his right to speak to the American public because it's the right of the voters to be informed as well,"" said John Coffee, a professor at Columbia Law School and an expert on corporate governance and white collar crime. In a recent survey of dozens of cases brought by Manhattan District Attorney's Office in which falsifying business records was the most serious charge at arraignment, attorney and author Norm Eisen found that roughly one in 10 of those cases resulted in a sentence of incarceration. ""I think that is fascinating,"" said Caroline Polisi, a criminal defense attorney and professor at Columbia Law School. ""A lot of commentators say the reason he won't be incarcerated is because the logistics of it with respect to the Secret Service would be too much. On the other hand, if you're saying he should be treated like any other defendant, we have a lot of data saying that 90% of other defendants would not get jail time in this situation."" The impact of the conviction on Trump's ability to campaign could largely hinge on what sentence Merchan ultimately hands down, and when Trump would serve it. ""In the context in which he is found guilty and then sentenced to no jail time, I don't think it's going to cause a bit of difference,"" added Polisi. ""There might be some minor issues. He might not be able to vote for himself. But other than that, I don't think it's going to cause any problems."" When determining Trump's sentence, the judge could take into account his numerous gag order violations — which led Merchan to threaten him with jail time if the violations continued — and his lack of demonstrated remorse or respect for the legal system. Throughout the trial, Trump referred to Merchan as ""conflicted"" and ""corrupt"" and to the case itself as a ""sham."" ""In New York, a 78-year-old defendant, who's a first time offender, committed a non-violent offense, and has an otherwise, well, distinguished record — in some regards being an ex-president is distinguished. In that kind of world, there'd be no chance of an incarceration sentence,"" said Coffee. Trump turns 78 on June 14. ""They can use probation, they can use fines. But there may be a view of many judges that you have to show that no one's above the law, and even the future president should have a taste of prison."" Even if Merchan does order Trump to serve time behind bars, the sentence could be deferred until his appeal has run its course. ""In other cases, when you don't have someone running for the White House, it would be more or acceptable to put him immediately into incarceration,"" said Coffee. ""You certainly could put special conditions on what he could do or put him under house arrest, but I think until we get to the actual election, we're going to have to let Donald Trump run around and campaign."" Trump has predicted that a conviction in this trial could boost his poll numbers. ""Even if convicted, I think that it has absolutely no impact. It may drive the numbers up, but we don't want that. We want to have a fair verdict,"" Trump told CBS Pittsburgh in an interview earlier this month. Trump's support among his Republican base has been remarkably resilient in the face of his various criminal cases. In the months following his four indictments last year, Trump maintained his commanding lead in the Republican primary, capturing the nomination despite the dozens of criminal charges he faced. Many Trump supporters who CBS News has interviewed since the trial began have said a guilty conviction will not change how they vote in November, adopting the former president's grievances as their own. ""Stormy Daniels has already been reviewed and stuff. It's kind of coincidental,"" Michigan resident Lori Beyer said at a recent rally in Freeland, Michigan, adding she would vote for Trump regardless of the conviction. ""I don't think it's going to impact it, as far as I'm concerned."" Whether a conviction changes the minds of voters who are not committed to the former president remains to be seen. A recent CBS News poll found that the majority of Americans believed Trump is ""definitely or probably"" guilty of the charges he faced in New York. The overwhelming majority of Democrats — 93% — believed Trump was guilty, while 78% Republicans said he was not. Independents were split, with 53% believing he was guilty and 47% saying he wasn't. Opinions about whether Trump was guilty or not were already highly partisan, according to Kabir Khanna, deputy director of elections and data analytics for CBS News. Most people who believed Trump was guilty also thought the jury would convict him, and vice versa. Additionally, Khanna said people who followed the trial closely were the most polarized in their views. ""Together, these factors could blunt the impact of the verdict on the views of an already divided public,"" Khanna said. ""Some voters may be swayed by the news, but I wouldn't expect a sea change."" Other polling supports that notion. A NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist survey released Thursday found that 67% of registered voters nationwide said a Trump conviction would not make a difference in how they vote. Among independents, just 11% said a guilty verdict would make them less likely to vote for Trump. The conviction also gives the Biden campaign a potentially potent new weapon in their arsenal: the ability to label Trump a convicted felon. Mr. Biden remained largely silent about the Trump trial while it was ongoing, but NBC News reported last week that he planned to become more aggressive about Trump's legal woes after the trial concluded, while acknowledging that Trump would be on the ballot regardless of how his legal cases played out. Trump has used the trial to help boost his fundraising, and will likely look to capitalize on the conviction. The Trump campaign and Republican National Committee saw an influx of donations after jury selection began, with the two entities raising $76 million in April. His campaign had about $50 million cash on hand at the beginning of May as he prepared to get back out on the campaign trail after the trial. The former president repeatedly used the developments in the trial to raise money, including when he was held in contempt for violating the gag order against him. ""I'd get arrested ONE MILLION TIMES before I'd let those filthy dogs get their hands on you,"" one typical fundraising appeal read. The New York case might be the only one of Trump's four criminal prosecutions to reach a conclusion before voters cast their ballots in the fall, giving the guilty verdict added weight. The two federal cases brought by special counsel Jack Smith remain in limbo. In Washington, D.C., Trump faces charges related to his actions to remain in power after the 2016 election. Trump has argued that he is immune from prosecution, and the Supreme Court is currently weighing his claim. The high court heard arguments in the immunity dispute on April 26 and is expected to issue a decision on the matter before the end of the court's term, likely in June. If the case is allowed to move forward, there is a slim possibility that the district court could schedule the trial before November. If the justices side with Trump and find him immune from prosecution, the charges would be dropped. In Florida, Trump faces federal charges stemming from his retention of classified documents after he left the White House. Judge Aileen Cannon, who was appointed by Trump, has indefinitely postponed the trial. She ruled in early May that picking a trial date would be ""imprudent and inconsistent with the court's duty to fully and fairly consider"" numerous unresolved pre-trial motions. Those motions include Trump's efforts to dismiss the case altogether, as well as issues related to what classified information can be revealed at trial. In the third case that remains outstanding, Trump faces state charges related to the 2020 election in Fulton County, Georgia. The trial in that matter is also on hold as Trump seeks to have District Attorney Fani Willis removed from the case. Georgia's Court of Appeals recently granted Trump's appeal of a decision that had allowed her to remain, bringing the trial to a temporary halt. Trump's two federal cases could largely be in voters' hands if they are not resolved by November, a fact that raises his personal stake in the outcome. If he wins and returns to the White House in January 2025, Trump could order the Justice Department to seek to drop the charges altogether. Trump has pleaded not guilty in all of the criminal cases against him. ",CBSnews,US
Trump's felony conviction can't keep him from becoming president,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-conviction-cant-keep-him-from-becoming-president/,The Constitution says nothing about criminal history in its very few qualifications for being president.,"Former President Trump's New York felony conviction Thursday on 34 counts of falsifying business records related to a ""hush money"" payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels can't stop him from becoming president if the voters put him back in office, legal scholars seem to agree. The Constitution imposes very few prerequisites for the presidency — a candidate must be at least 35 years of age, a natural-born citizen and a U.S. resident for a minimum of 14 years. It says nothing about the impact of a felony conviction on a president's ability to serve. ""The short answer is yes, that there's no constitutional bar,"" said Corey Brettschneider, a lawyer and professor of political science at Brown University and author of ""The Presidents and the People."" ""The Constitution lays out some specific requirements of what's required … but there's nothing explicitly in the Constitution about being convicted of a crime as a disqualification."" ""There's a wide understanding that the qualifications listed in the Constitution are exclusive — that is, we can't add to those qualifications,"" said Derek Muller, an election law professor at the University of Notre Dame. He added, ""Whether or not you've been convicted of a felony is immaterial for qualification purposes."" Jessica Levinson, a constitutional law professor at Loyola University and a CBS News contributor, stated plainly: ""The Constitution does not have any prohibition on serving as president if you're a convicted felon."" Some states have tried to disqualify Trump under the 14th Amendment's insurrection clause in the wake of the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol assault. Last December, the Colorado Supreme Court allowed Trump to be removed from the primary ballot over 14th Amendment concerns, due to his conduct surrounding Jan. 6. The amendment's insurrection clause, the court found, bars insurrectionists who have previously taken an oath to support the Constitution from holding public office. But the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the ruling in March, finding that Trump had to be restored to the ballot because only Congress can enforce the insurrection clause. The high court's ruling resolved challenges to Trump's eligibility for office pursued by voters in several other states. ""Absent a [new] statute that lays out that disqualification, it isn't a bar,'"" Brettschneider said. The Constitution gives Congress power to enact laws that would enforce the 3rd section of the 14th Amendment, Brettschneider explained. His sentence may not include prison time, but practically speaking, the implications of a sentence could be more complex if Trump becomes president. ""You could be convicted of a felony and still not have jail time, right?"" Muller said. ""You could just have a fine; you could have probation."" But there's no law against running for president and winning an election while imprisoned — or from serving as president from prison. If he is sentenced to prison and wins the election, Trump's attorneys might argue that sitting presidents can't be imprisoned, just as Trump has argued that sitting presidents can't be indicted. ""You could say there's something inherent in the office of president suggesting that states can't incarcerate people serving in federal office or holding those federal officers,"" Muller said. ""There's a little bit of precedent on this. In some old cases that go back 200 years, there were some disputes about states trying to have cases involving federal officers to remove them from office, and the Supreme Court has been clear that states have no authority to do this."" The 25th Amendment could be a factor, both Muller and Levinson said. Section 3 of the 25th Amendment says that ""whenever the vice president and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the president pro tempore of the Senate and the speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the president is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the vice president shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as acting president."" It could be argued that a president who is behind bars is unable to carry out his office, Muller said. Whether a convicted president serving time from behind bars could have a Cabinet confirmed could largely depend on the outcome of Senate elections, said Brandon Johnson, assistant professor at the Nebraska College of Law, who wrote an essay in the Harvard Law Review last year on the topic of a ""convict in chief."" And if Trump were able to confirm a Cabinet, those members would likely be loyal to him and unwilling to supplant him. The 25th Amendment also says ""such other body as Congress may by law provide"" could get the ball rolling to transmit presidential powers to the vice president, Johnson wrote. ""The congressional route I think is pretty much going to be a nonstarter too, unless there's a significant change in the 2024 election, because Congress would have to agree to establish this body to begin with to review the president's fitness for office,"" Johnson told CBS News. Johnson argues that the most natural reading of the 25th Amendment would seem to require the vice president's cooperation. ""But if the vice president's acquiescence is required, then the creation of a congressional body to declare the president unable to carry out their duties could face the same obstacles,"" Johnson wrote. And so far, congressional Republicans have remained steadfast in their support for Trump following his conviction, with House Speaker Mike Johnson calling the trial ""a purely political exercise, not a legal one,"" and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell writing that ""these charges never should have been brought in the first place. I expect the conviction to be overturned on appeal."" Trump, should he become president, cannot pardon himself from the New York conviction because it's a state conviction, rather than a federal one. Presidents are only empowered to pardon federal crimes. Trump faces three more criminal cases — a state indictment in Georgia over alleged attempts to overturn the election; a federal indictment in Florida over his handling of classified documents; and a federal indictment in Washington, D.C., over alleged efforts to overturn the presidential election. –Melissa Quinn contributed to this report.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says he opposed removal of Confederate monuments,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/robert-f-kennedy-jr-confederate-monuments/,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he had a ""visceral reaction against"" the destruction of monuments honoring southern leaders from the Civil War.","Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says he opposed the removal of Confederate statues, recalling that he had a ""visceral reaction against"" the destruction of monuments honoring southern leaders from the Civil War. The top Confederate general, Robert E. Lee, had ""extraordinary qualities of leadership"" that deserve to be celebrated, Kennedy said Friday in an interview with the conservative podcast host Tim Pool on the Timcast IRL. ""There were heroes in the Confederacy who didn't have slaves,"" Kennedy said when asked about the monuments. ""And, you know ... I just have a visceral reaction to this destroying history. I don't like it. I think we should celebrate who we are. And that, you know, we should celebrate the good qualities of everybody."" Celebrating only people who were ""completely virtuous"" would mean erasing all of history, Kennedy said. The comment is another controversial pronouncement from the former Democrat, who is waging an uphill battle to become the first person since George Washington to be elected president without a political party affiliation. Kennedy, who is trying to stitch together a coalition of Americans disaffected with both major parties, has promoted himself as a fierce advocate for free speech who is willing to take controversial stands in his bid for the presidency. Allies of both Joe Biden and Donald Trump, the presumptive Democratic and Republican nominees, respectively, view Kennedy with trepidation and worry that Kennedy will earn enough support to tilt the election. Activists have pushed for years to remove monuments and rename buildings that honor leaders of the Confederacy, calling them symbols of racism. ""We need to be able to be sophisticated enough to live with, you know, our ancestors who didn't agree with us on everything and who did things that are now regarded as immoral or wrong, because they, you know, maybe they had other qualities,"" Kennedy said.

Texas Rep. Tony Gonzales barely wins GOP runoff against gun-rights activist,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tony-gonzalez-wins-gop-runoff-gun-rights-activist-brandon-herrera/,Republican Rep. Tony Gonzales of Texas narrowly won his primary runoff against a gun-rights activist. Gonzales' backers had warned that a loss could open the door for Democrats to flip the district in November.,"Austin, Texas — Republican Rep. Tony Gonzales of Texas narrowly won his primary Tuesday against a gun-rights activist who pushed the border congressman into a bruising runoff that threatened to unseat a U.S. House incumbent. Another prominent Texas Republican, state House Speaker Dade Phelan, also edged out a challenger from the right who was backed by former President Donald Trump. Both won by razor-thin margins, reflecting the anger of hard-line conservatives and a wave of party turbulence in America's biggest red state over votes that bucked party lines and the impeachment of state Attorney General Ken Paxton. Gonzales defeated Brandon Herrera, a gun enthusiast who calls himself ""The AK Guy"" on social media and attacked him over positions that angered the GOP's hard right in Texas. Supporters of Gonzales had warned that a loss in Tuesday's election could open the door for Democrats to flip the district in November. During the campaign, Herrera attacked the two-term Republican over his support for a gun-safety bill after the 2022 Uvalde school shooting - which happened in Gonzales' district - and past criticism of hard-line immigration proposals. Gonzales will face Democrat Santos Limon in the November general election. Gonzales, whose critics cast him as a moderate within the GOP, called some of his hard-right colleagues in Congress ""scumbags"" during an interview with CNN in April. He was censured by the Republican Party of Texas in 2023 over his support for same-sex marriage protections at the federal level and the bipartisan gun-safety bill following the Uvalde mass shooting. But Gonzales drew support from top Republicans - including Texas Gov. Greg Abbott - at a time when the party holds a thin majority in the House. U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson attended a fundraiser for Gonzales. Herrera is a gun manufacturer who posts videos about weapons and gun rights and has more than 3 million followers on YouTube. Gonzales told CBS News in a recent interview that these lawmakers and his opponent aren't ""serious people."" ""There's a bigger battle happening outside this race, and it is what is the future of the Republican party going to look like?"" Gonzales said. ""Is it going to be governing conservatives like myself, or is it going to be these bomb-throwing gestures that want to come up here and burn the place down?"" Given his backing by establishment Republicans, Gonzales significantly outraised Herrera in the race. Gonzales had brought in $3.4 million through May 8 compared to $367,000 for Herrera through the same period. Gonzales attacked Herrera for having having moved to the district only in the past few years, while Herrera pounced on Gonzales' vote in 2022 for the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which included a provision for the ""boyfriend"" loophole for gun purchases, the first time any type of gun control legislation has passed Congress since the 1990s. Gonzales was one of 14 Republicans who voted for the bill. In the interview with CBS News, Gonzales defended his vote and said he ""worked very hard"" to ensure the legislation ""protected the Constitution, but also solved some problems."" ""What it did do is raise increased background checks for minors, and I think that is a positive thing,"" Gonzales said. Gonzales told ""Face the Nation"" Sunday that he ""knew it at the time"" when he cast the vote for the 2022 bill that it would hurt him politically, but he insisted he's not ""afraid of that vote."" Phelan, who finished second in March to challenger David Covey, a former local party chairman and oil and gas consultant who was backed by Trump, rallied to scrape out the primary win Tuesday. Phelan's victory at least temporarily staved off a push from Paxton and others to force him out of his leadership role in the state's dominant party. But a shakeup in the Texas Capitol could still lay ahead. While the win keeps Phelan on the general election ballot in his southeast Texas district, the bruising primary fight leaves questions about his ability to retain the speakership. At his election night party, Phelan declared victory in what he called ""a terrible, awful, knockdown, drag-out"" fight and told supporters he will remain speaker. ""I think this runoff did me a favor,"" Phelan said. ""It let my voters know what my real record is."" The race was a snapshot of fractures within the GOP nationally. Phelan, who has been speaker since 2021, came under fire after his chamber voted last year to impeach Paxton on bribery and corruption charges. Paxton was later acquitted in the state Senate. Phelan presided over votes that enacted some of the toughest anti-abortion laws in the country, vastly expanded gun rights, supported Abbott's highly visible anti-immigration platforms and curtailed LGBTQ+ rights. After Phelan declared victory, Covey and Paxton accused him of attracting Democrats to vote for him in the Republican primary and push him over the top. Texas has an open primary system, meaning voters can cross party lines to vote. ""Dade Phelan may have won this election, but in doing so, he has irrevocably destroyed his already feeble legacy,"" Covey said. Katrina Pierson, a former spokeswoman for Trump, defeated incumbent Justin Holland for his state House seat in the Dallas suburbs. Holland was among House Republicans who voted to impeach Paxton. He also voted in favor of raising the age for purchasing assault rifles from 18 to 21 and against Abbott's plan to spend public education money on private schools. Abbott campaigned for Pierson. Republicans picked Jay Furman, a retired Navy veteran, as the nominee to run in November against Henry Cuellar, a longtime Democratic congressman who along with his wife was indicted this spring on federal bribery, money laundering and fraud charges. Cuellar has said he is innocent; three associates have pleaded guilty in related investigations. Furman defeated rancher and businessman Lazaro Garza in the South Texas district that Cuellar has held since 2005. Both campaigned on tighter border security and immigration restrictions. There was another Cuellar on the ballot, as well: Rosie Cuellar, his sister, was defeated by Cecilia Castellano in the Democratic runoff for a South Texas state House seat. The March primary was held before Henry Cuellar was indicted. The winner advances to the November general election against Republican Don McLaughlin, who was mayor of Uvalde when the school shooting happened. Republicans also chose real estate businessman and state House Rep. Craig Goldman over construction company businessman John O'Shea to replace outgoing U.S. Rep. Kay Granger, the nation's longest-serving GOP congresswoman. Goldman will face Democrat Trey Hunt in the heavily-Republican district anchored in Fort Worth. Granger, 81, was first elected in 1996 and is a former chairwoman of the powerful House Appropriations Committee. She announced last year she would not seek re-election. -- Caroline Linton contributed reporting ",CBSnews,US
NATO allies brace for possible Trump 2024 victory,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nato-allies-brace-possible-trump-president/,U.S. NATO allies are preparing for the changing political realities that a Trump presidency could bring.,"London — With six months to go until the presidential election, America's NATO allies are planning to boost their defense spending ahead of the potential disruption of a second Donald Trump presidency. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg is preparing a funding plan to try to insulate the 75-year-old military partnership from any changing political realities that might affect the alliance, according to Oana Lungescu, who until last year was the longtime lead NATO spokesperson for Stoltenberg. ""It is important to have predictability both for allies and for Ukraine,"" Lungescu told CBS News. ""This [plan] relieves the U.S. of some of its organizational burden while still maintaining full oversight,"" she said. Stoltenberg has proposed a $107 billion, five-year package of military aid for Ukraine that would give the broader alliance a more direct role in funding, Reuters reported last month. Under the plan, European allies would create a shared Ukraine aid fund and increase their contributions to Kyiv's war effort, reducing the sizable funding provided by the U.S. Trump's first term as president demonstrated that the 2024 presumptive Republican nominee is unafraid to upend the NATO alliance. Trump shocked America's allies with his open criticism of the failure of some NATO members to meet defense funding commitments, and the Trump campaign has said that calling on allies to increase their defense spending is a policy that a future Trump White House would aggressively pursue. In an emailed statement, Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that ""President Trump got our allies to increase their NATO spending by demanding they pay up, but Crooked Joe Biden went back to letting them take advantage of the American taxpayer."" ""When President Trump returns to the Oval Office, he will restore peace and rebuild American strength and deterrence on the world stage,"" Leavitt said. Lungescu said that the strategy proposed by Stoltenberg would address Trump's complaint that NATO allies aren't doing enough to share the economic burden. At the same time, Stoltenberg is trying to protect Ukraine from the kind of severe delays in Congress — mostly driven by House Republicans — that halted U.S. aid and weapons funding for the first half of the year. NATO allies are also increasing their own individual defense spending, Lungescu told CBS News, although she also pointed out that American presidents dating back to Eisenhower have criticized NATO partners for not contributing enough. NATO guidelines say member states should commit a minimum of 2% of their Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to defense spending to continue to ensure the Alliance's military readiness. By NATO's own admission, in terms of GDP, the wealth of its members ""nearly equals that of the U.S."" But ""non-U.S. Allies together spend less than half of what the United States spends on defense,"" according to NATO's website. As of 2023, only 10 of the 30 other NATO allies had met the 2% spending commitment, excluding the U.S., though two-thirds of the NATO allies are expected to meet the target by the end of the year. ""I think by the time we get to the Washington NATO summit in July, we will have updated figures and will be in an even better position in terms of significantly increased defense spending,"" Lungescu predicted. In February, former President Trump said at a campaign rally in South Carolina that he'd encourage Russia to ""do whatever the hell they want"" to NATO allies who don't pay their fair share into the Western military alliance. Referring to a conversation with an unnamed leader of an NATO country who asked him, ""If we don't pay, are you still going to protect us,"" Trump said he replied, ""Absolutely not."" Since Trump left office in Jan. 2021, his former national security adviser, John Bolton, has said the former president had been close to withdrawing the U.S.from NATO at the end of a 2018 summit and said another Trump term presents an existential threat to the trans-Atlantic alliance. ""Many [NATO] countries owe us a tremendous amount of money… The United States has paid and stepped up like nobody,"" Trump said at a July 2018 NATO gathering, adding that ""something has to be done."" ""I think Trump will cause significant damage in a second term, damage that in some cases will be irreparable,"" Bolton wrote in his 2020 memoir, ""The Room Where It Happened."" He said he believes Trump intends to pull America out of the alliance if reelected. ""I think he fully intends to do that,"" Bolton wrote. ""I think that would be a catastrophic decision for America and a whole host of other things. It's a very grim prospect to see Trump in for a second term."" ""I think that actually the biggest danger he [Trump] is for NATO is his unpredictability,"" Ben Hodges, a former commanding general of the U.S. Army in Europe, told CBS News. ""The urgency of defense investment is even greater if Trump turns out to be not as dependable as every other American president has been."" Hodges said that a way to ensure that NATO allies maintain smooth diplomatic relations with any incoming Trump administration would be for America's allies to honor their commitments and increase their defense spending now. But he's skeptical that Mr. Trump would move to withdraw the U.S. from NATO, pointing to a law passed in Congress last year that prohibits the president from withdrawing from NATO or using any appropriated funds for that purpose without approval from lawmakers. A recent war game run by Finley Grimble, a former intelligence analyst for the U.K. Ministry of Defense, found that in the event of a second Trump presidency, the alliance would be vulnerable to collapse, even if the U.S. doesn't  withdraw from NATO. Grimble's war game ran a scenario in which Trump wins the election. The new administration immediately attempts to unilaterally broker a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia. The talks break down and Trump then slashes foreign aid to Ukraine. In the absence of having the congressional majority needed to formally withdraw the U.S. from the NATO treaty, the Trump White House then significantly reduces U.S. participation in NATO exercises, including moving 50% of America's military presence in Europe, to the Indo-Pacific region. Grimble told CBS News that his analysis showed such a scenario would leave NATO a ""hollowed out, unprepared shell"" by pursuing a policy of NATO ""dormancy."" In Grimble's war game, Trump takes advantage of NATO's command structure in which the supreme allied commander of NATO forces in Europe is always a U.S. officer and is responsible for the overall command of NATO military operations. ""NATO has these war-fighting plans that are ready to roll out… but the supreme allied commander in Europe would answer to Donald Trump,"" Grimble told CBS News. ""You tell [the NATO supreme allied commander] to stop cooperating, to stop enacting the plans, and the whole thing falls apart. And that's what Trump did in the game,"" he said. ",CBSnews,US
DNC plans to nominate Biden and Harris virtually before convention,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dnc-biden-nomination-virtually-august-convention-chicago/,The Democratic National Committee wants to nominate President Biden and Vice President Harris virtually before the scheduled convention to ensure meeting Ohio's Aug. 7 ballot certification deadline.,"The Democratic Party plans to nominate President Biden and Vice President Harris virtually before its scheduled convention in late August to meet an Aug. 7 ballot certification deadline in Ohio, CBS News has learned. The move means the most dramatic and obvious reason for Democrats to hold their quadrennial meetings will once again be held over Zoom instead of in person, even though the convention is poised to continue as scheduled. Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine has recalled state legislators for a special session this week to try to change state ballot requirements. Talks between Democrats and Republicans before the regularly scheduled session ended in Columbus failed to reach a deal. ""Ohio is running out of time to get Joe Biden, the sitting president of the United States, on the ballot this fall,"" DeWine said last week. ""Failing to do so is simply unacceptable. This is ridiculous. This is (an) absurd situation."" The Democrats are scheduled to hold their convention Aug. 19-22, meaning the president's formal nomination would miss the current Ohio deadline. To avoid any confusion and to ensure access to the Ohio ballot, DNC officials say the party's rules and bylaws subcommittee plans to vote next Tuesday to recommend to the full body that the president and vice president be nominated virtually. Officials noted this is similar to what occurred in 2020, when Mr. Biden and Harris had to be nominated virtually after the pandemic severely curtailed the meetings of the party's quadrennial convention. ""Joe Biden will be on the ballot in Ohio and all 50 states, and Ohio Republicans agree. But when the time has come for action, they have failed to act every time, so Democrats will land this plane on our own,"" DNC Chairman Jaime Harrison said in a statement. ""Through a virtual roll call, we will ensure that Republicans can't chip away at our democracy through incompetence or partisan tricks and that Ohioans can exercise their right to vote for the presidential candidate of their choice."" A DNC official said that despite the virutal nomination, the Chicago convention ""will continue to serve as an important convening event for Democrats across the country.""

Jan. 6 officers to campaign for Biden in battleground states,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/january-6-officers-campaign-biden-battleground-states/,"The Biden campaign says the men will meet with locals to ""raise the alarm"" about a second Trump term.","Veteran officers who defended the Capitol during the attack on Jan. 6, 2021, will campaign for President Biden in key battleground states, the campaign announced on Tuesday. The officers will be warning voters what could happen if Donald Trump is elected again, the Biden campaign said. Former Sgt. Aquilino Gonell, former U.S. Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn, and D.C. police officer Danny Hodges will act as surrogates for the campaign in states including Nevada, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan and New Hampshire in the weeks and months ahead. The campaign says the trio will underscore Trump's praise for the Jan. 6 rioters, including having called them ""unbelievable patriots,"" and how Trump said he'll be a dictator on ""day one"" of a second term. Trump has also said there will be a ""bloodbath"" if Mr. Biden wins in November. Gonell, Dunn and Hodges were all assaulted by rioters during the Capitol attack. Since then, they have become prominent voices reminding the public what happened on Jan. 6, as some Republicans on Capitol Hill have tried to downplay the day's violence. A U.S. Capitol plaque honoring the police heroes of the day was required to be installed by March 2023, but it still hasn't happened, as CBS News' Scott MacFarlane has reported. Dunn ran for the Democratic nomination in Maryland's 3rd Congressional District but ulitmately fell short to state Sen. Sarah Elfreth in May. The Biden campaign says the men will meet with elected officials and law enforcement organizations to ""raise the alarm"" about a second Trump term. ""Donald Trump and his unhinged quest for power and retribution pose an existential threat to our democracy,"" Dunn said in a statement released by the campaign. ""He continues to embrace political violence, going as far as saying there will be a 'bloodbath' if he loses again and promising to be a dictator on 'day one' and pardon January 6 rioters. Donald Trump only cares about Donald Trump, which is why come November, Americans will reject his extremism once and for all and reelect the only candidate in the race committed to protecting our democracy and standing up for law enforcement: Joe Biden."" Officers who defended the Capitol on Jan. 6, including Dunn, appeared at a Biden campaign press conference outside the Manhattan courthouse Tuesday where closing arguments are happening in Trump's criminal hush money case. ""I heard distress calls coming from fellow police officers on the Capitol as thousands of Trump supporters rushed them and brutally assaulted members of law enforcement,"" former D.C. police officer Michael Fanone said. ""That day, I like many other hundreds of other D.C. police officers put on a uniform and responded to the Capitol to assist our brothers and sisters in law enforcement."" The Department of Justice has charged more than 1,200 people with crimes related to the Jan. 6 Capitol assault, with hundreds of guilty pleas and convictions. The veteran officers have described how they still recall Jan. 6 vividly. ""I was assaulted many times throughout the day,"" Hodges told NPR in an interview in January. ""I was beaten, punched, kicked, pushed, beaten with my own riot baton in the head, crushed with a police shield. Someone tried to gouge out one of my eyes.""

Texas' Tony Gonzales tries to fight off YouTube personality in runoff election,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tony-gonzales-texas-23rd-congressional-district-runoff-brandon-herrera/,"Rep. Tony Gonzales of Texas faces YouTube personality Brandon Herrera, known as ""The AK Guy,"" in runoff on Tuesday.","The Texas Republican Party gathered in San Antonio for its annual convention this weekend, but GOP Rep. Tony Gonzales, who represents part of San Antonio and lives there, was ambivalent about attending. That's not entirely surprising — one of the featured speakers was Rep. Matt Gaetz, who endorsed Gonzales' opponent, Brandon Herrera, in Tuesday's GOP primary runoff in the 23rd District. The Texas Republican Party censured Gonzales last year over his vote for gun control legislation backed by the Biden White House, introduced in the wake of the 2022 Uvalde school shooting that killed 19 students and two teachers. Uvalde is also in the 23rd District. Gonzales had four Republican opponents in the March primary, which stretches 800 miles from San Antonio along the U.S.-Mexico border to El Paso. Gonzales failed to secure 50% of the vote, forcing him into a runoff with Herrera, the next highest vote getter. The runoff winner will face Democrat Santos Limon in November. Herrera only won 24% of the vote in the March primary, but the runoff has been a headache for Gonzales. With a runoff date so long after the primary and no big-ticket races on the ballot, turnout is likely to be low. ""If this was a high-turnout election, [Gonzales] would be a lock,"" said Mark Jones, a Rice University political science professor. In a low-turnout election, ""anything can happen,"" he said, because the most fervent voters are the ones who go to the polls. Jones said a candidate needs to ""mobilize a handful of the most diehard supporters"" to win. That could be challenging for Gonzales, who's positioned himself as the pragmatic choice, compared to Herrera, a 28-year-old YouTube celebrity known as ""The AK Guy"" who has continually hit Gonzales over his  gun legislation vote. ""What we're seeing in Congressional District 23 is the story we see all over Texas politics,"" said Joshua Blank of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas, Austin, ""which is that an incumbent, usually a Republican legislator, takes a position that is not 100% in line with the most conservative voters in their district."" This ""creates the conditions for a primary challenger to try and unseat that member,"" Blank said. He suggested that the Uvalde vote had this very effect: ""You can't detach what's going on there and the fact that an extreme gun rights YouTube personality is now in a runoff against him."" Since the March primary, Gonzales has received endorsements from GOP establishment figures, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick. In addition to Gaetz, Herrera has been endorsed by other House Freedom Caucus members. In response to those endorsements, Gonzales said on CNN in March that he serves ""with some real scumbags"" and told CBS News in a recent interview that these lawmakers and his opponent aren't ""serious people."" ""There's a bigger battle happening outside this race, and it is what is the future of the Republican party going to look like?"" Gonzales said. ""Is it going to be governing conservatives like myself, or is it going to be these bomb-throwing gestures that want to come up here and burn the place down?"" Herrera's far-right campaign and alliance with Gaetz and the Freedom Caucus would seem to align him with former President Donald Trump, but Trump hasn't endorsed in the race and has said little about it. However, on his YouTube radio show, Herrera has made jokes about Trump's son Barron Trump and said that Trump couldn't win the general election. Gonzales has tried to position himself as a ""MAGA"" candidate, and he has endorsed Trump's presidential campaign. Given his backing by establishment Republicans, Gonzales has significantly outraised Herrera in the race. Gonzales has raised $3.4 million through May 8, compared to $367,000 for Herrera through the same period. Gonzales has attacked Herrera for having having moved to the district only in the past few years, while Herrera has pounced on Gonzales' vote in 2022 for the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which included a provision for the ""boyfriend"" loophole for gun purchases, the first time any type of gun control legislation has passed Congress since the 1990s. Gonzales was one of 14 Republicans who voted for the bill. In a recent interview with CBS News, Gonzales defended his vote and said he ""worked very hard"" to ensure the legislation ""protected the Constitution, but also solved some problems."" ""What it did do is raise increased background checks for minors, and I think that is a positive thing,"" Gonzales said. Gonzales told ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday that he ""knew it at the time"" when he cast the vote for the 2022 bill that it would hurt him politically, but he insisted he's not ""afraid of that vote."" Although the district includes much of the U.S.-Mexico border area, immigration has not been as contentious an issue as gun control has. University of Texas San Antonio political science professor Jon Taylor noted Gonzales had once tried to position himself as being more pragmatic on the border but has since moved further to the right, much closer to Herrera on the issue. Gonzales was first elected in 2020 after Republican Rep. Will Hurd decided not to run again. In 2018, Hurd barely defeated Democrat Gina Ortiz Jones by just 1,000 votes. The 23rd District was once considered the ""only swing district in Texas,"" says Blank, but the redistricting after the 2020 election made it considerably redder, which has allowed an extremist candidate like Herrera to win more votes. If Herrera wins the primary, Blank said it's an ""open question if Herrera is an electable candidate in a general election — even in a district drawn to favor Republicans.""

What happens if Trump is convicted in New York? No one can really say,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-happens-if-trump-is-convicted-in-new-york-trial/,"Trump was tried in New York state court, where judges have broad authority to determine when sentences are handed down after convictions, says a former prosecutor.","Update: The jury found Trump guilty on all charges. Follow the latest updates here. Our earlier story is below. When the judge overseeing Donald Trump's criminal trial found on May 6 that Trump had violated a gag order for a 10th time, he told him that ""the last thing I want to do is to put you in jail."" ""You are the former president of the United States and possibly the next president, as well,"" said Justice Juan Merchan, reflecting on the momentous weight of such a decision. Whether to jail the Republican Party's presumptive nominee for president is a choice that Merchan may soon face again, if jurors in Trump's ""hush money"" case vote to convict him. Jurors began deliberations over reaching a verdict on Wednesday after receiving instructions from the judge. What exactly would happen if the jury finds Trump guilty is difficult to predict. Trump is being tried in New York state court, where judges have broad authority to determine when sentences are handed down after convictions and what exactly they will be, according to former Manhattan prosecutor Duncan Levin. That differs from federal court, where there's typically a waiting period between a conviction and sentencing. ""It's much more informally done in state court. I've had cases where the jury comes back and says, 'guilty,' and the judge thanks the jury, and excuses them, and says, 'Let's sentence the defendant right now,"" said Levin. ""Obviously, everything's a little different about this case than the typical case."" Each of the 34 felony falsification of business records charges that Trump is facing carries a sentence of up to four years in prison and a $5,000 fine. He has pleaded not guilty. Norm Eisen, an author and attorney, recently analyzed dozens of cases brought by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office in which falsifying business records was the most serious charge at arraignment. He found that roughly one in 10 of those cases resulted in a sentence of incarceration. But he also cautioned that those prosecutions often involved other charges and noted the dynamics at play in Trump's case make his sentence particularly hard to forecast. If Trump is found guilty, Merchan would have fairly wide leeway in determining a punishment, including sentencing Trump to probation or house arrest. Levin said the option of confining Trump to his home, followed by a period on probation, might be appealing to Merchan, who has repeatedly indicated he's concerned about limiting a presidential candidate's ability to speak freely. Such an option would allow Trump to do interviews and access social media from his home. From the day Trump was first arraigned, on April 4, 2023, Merchan has said he was loath to interfere with Trump's ability to campaign. ""He is a candidate for the presidency of the United States. So, those First Amendment rights are critically important, obviously,"" Merchan said that day. And on May 6, he opined more broadly on the additional people who would be burdened by jailing Trump. Merchan called incarceration ""truly a last resort for me,"" saying, ""I also worry about the people who would have to execute that sanction: the court officers, the correction officers, the Secret Service detail, among others."" Still, that day, he cautioned Trump that jail is not out of the question. ""I want you to understand that I will, if necessary and appropriate,"" Merchan said. It's a possibility that officials in state and federal agencies, including the Secret Service, have already had to consider, conferring after the judge in the case threatened Trump with jail after his 10th violation of a gag order. As a former president, Trump is entitled to Secret Service protection for the rest of his life, wherever he happens to be. Behind bars, corrections officers would in turn be responsible for protecting those agents assigned to Trump. Where Trump might serve any jail or prison sentence is one of many factors that remains up in the air. Shorter sentences can be served at the city's Rikers Island Jail Complex, which has two wings that are typically used for high-profile or infamous inmates. (Neither, of course, has ever held someone who comes with his own security detail.) Officials must have a plan in place, just in case, said Levin. ""He could be remanded on the spot,"" Levin said.

"After Haley said she'd vote for Trump, Biden campaign met with her supporters",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nikki-haley-trump-vote-biden-campaign-woos-supporters/,"After Nikki Haley announced she'd vote for Donald Trump, the Biden campaign met with her supporters that very evening.","Soon after former GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley announced Wednesday she would vote for former President Donald Trump this November, the Biden campaign held a virtual meeting with her supporters on that very evening. Several Haley supporters, including some of her former state leadership team and members of the ""Women for Nikki"" coalition, joined the call from across the country. The meeting was arranged by Robert Schwartz, the executive director of the anti-Trump Haley Voters Working Group. The deputy political director of the Biden campaign, Juan Peñalosa, joined the call to stress how important the Haley coalition's support would be to defeating Trump and addressed the differences Haley supporters have with Mr. Biden, according to Schwartz. He said that while some of Haley's voters might be open to voting for the president, there are strong policy disagreements. ""A lot of them have not said that they're going to vote for Joe Biden; a lot of them are actually considering writing in Nikki Haley,"" Schwartz said. ""There's a wide range of views, but it's certainly not preaching to the converted."" Although she dropped her presidential bid in March, Haley has still managed to attract hundreds of thousands of votes across several Republican primaries, including in key swing states. In Pennsylvania's Republican primary in April, over 157,000 voted for Haley, representing roughly 16% of the total share of vote. In Wisconsin, also in April, Haley finished with almost 13% of the GOP primary vote, close to 77,000. Mr. Biden, who has been trailing Trump in recent polling in these states, won both in 2020, but his margin of victory was very slim — about 21,000 in Wisconsin, and around 82,000 in Pennsylvania. Schwartz says he shared a list of issues that are priorities for Haley supporters with the Biden campaign, like supporting Israel and addressing the crisis at the U.S. southern border. He added that he's been working with Biden's reelection team to gather information about what it was about Haley that appealed to these Republican voters and what messages would be likely to resonate with them. After Haley announced she'd vote for Trump, one former Haley volunteer, Alissa Baker, who's a member of the working group said she remains opposed to Trump. ""As a private citizen, she has to make the same choices that we do,"" Baker said. ""She gave her reason, and I respect that. I also respect that she isn't endorsing or telling her supporters how to vote. It doesn't change my thinking on how I will vote in November at this point."" In an email Thursday, the Biden campaign said of its collaboration with Haley Voters Working Group, ""While Donald Trump continues to attack moderate Republican and independent voters, the Biden campaign is investing to talk to these voters and working to earn their support.""

Biden campaign ad slams Trump on guns 2 years after Uvalde school shooting,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-campaign-ad-uvalde-slamming-trump-gun-control/,"The Biden campaign released a new ad highlighting the Uvalde school shooting, as well as a Trump attack ad narrated by Robert De Niro.","Two years after the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, the Biden campaign released a new digital ad that hammers former President Donald Trump on gun control. ""We honor those we lost in Uvalde,"" the ad says in text that appears over a black screen. As ""Ave Maria"" plays, the text continues, and an altar memorializing the 19 children and two teachers in the 2022 massacre appears and then transitions to photos of President Biden and first lady Jill Biden visiting Uvalde soon afterward. ""Joe Biden expanded background checks, and is fighting to ban assault weapons,"" the text reads. Over a video of a mouth speaking, the words ""Donald Trump did nothing to keep us safe"" appear. The ad concludes with a final image of the Bidens at a Uvalde memorial and the words, ""I'll never forget, I'll never stop fighting."" The 30-second ad is part of the campaign's seven-figure media ad buy for May targeting Latino voters. It will run in the battleground states of Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Nevada and will also include subtitles in Spanish. This is the Uvalde ad: ""No family should have to experience the pain and trauma that families in Uvalde will continue to experience for the rest of their lives,"" Julie Chavez Rodriguez, the Biden-Harris campaign manager said in a statement. ""As guns remain the number one cause of death for young people in America, President Biden and Vice President Harris understand the urgency of this crisis and have brought bipartisan leaders together to deliver historic action to combat gun violence."" It's the latest effort by the Biden campaign to target Hispanic voters in key states where Latino voters are expected to play a critical role in determining the outcome of the election in November. In 2020, President Biden won Arizona by less than 11,000 votes. This year, one in four Arizona voters will be Latino. The latest CBS poll shows Mr. Biden is currently trailing Trump by 5 points.. With six months left before the election, the Biden campaign has been ramping up its attacks on Trump. On the same day the Uvalde ad was released, the campaign also dropped a new TV spot narrated by actor Robert De Niro. The ad ""Snapped"" set to run across battleground states, focuses on Trump's past presidency as the Biden campaign intends to sway voters away from their political rival. ""We knew Trump was out of control when he was president,"" the ad says. ""Then he lost the 2020 election and snapped."" A series of phrases appear — ""dictator,"" ""bloodbath,"" ""terminate the Constitution"" — in an effort to paint a dark and disturbing picture of what a second term for Trump would look like. The De Niro-narrated ad is part of the campaign's strategy to ramp up its attacks in the month ahead of the first general election presidential debate, which is set for June 27, in Atlanta.

Political consultant allegedly behind fake Biden robocall indicted,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/steve-kramer-indicited-fcc-fine-political-consultant-fake-biden-robocall/,New Hampshire's attorney general announced Thursday that Steve Kramer was indicted on 26 charges in the state and the FCC said he had been fined $6 million.,"The political consultant who admitted to orchestrating a fake robocall impersonating President Biden ahead of New Hampshire's Democratic primary earlier this year has been indicted on 26 charges in the state and fined $6 million by the Federal Communications Commission. New Hampshire's attorney general announced Thursday that Steve Kramer was indicted on 13 felony counts of voter suppression and bribery and 13 counts of impersonation of a candidate in multiple state jurisdictions, and additionally Kramer was fined $6 million by the FCC for the illegal robocalls. In a recording of the call obtained by CBS News, a voice that sounds like Mr. Biden's tells Democratic Granite State voters to ""save"" their vote for the November general election and to stay at home. ""Voting this Tuesday only enables Republicans in their quest to elect Donald Trump again,"" the voice says. ""Your vote makes a difference this November, not this Tuesday."" It was the first time that ""deepfake"" technology became intertwined with a U.S. election, and this week, U.S. intelligence agencies warned about the threat of generative AI heading into November in a bulletin obtained by CBS News. Kramer is accused of orchestrating the robocall. In an interview with CBS New York, Kramer said he wanted to call attention to the need for federal and state regulation on the use of artificial intelligence in politics, adding that he spent $500 in creating the fake Biden voice. About 5,000 people received the call, according to Kramer. ""For me to do that and get $5 million worth of exposure -- not for me, I kept myself anonymous — so that the regulations could just play themselves out or at least begin to play themselves out, I don't need to be famous. That's not my intention. My intention was to make a difference,"" Steve Kramer told CBS New York. CBS News has reached out to Kramer for comment on the indictment. After the call, the Federal Communications Commission announced a unanimous ruling in early February that made AI-generated voices in robocalls illegal. The FCC also separately fined Lingo Telecom, the originating provider of Kramer's alleged calls, $2 million for ""apparently violating the FCC's caller ID authentication rules."" In an interview with NBC News, a New Orleans magician said he created the robocall, and further reporting by the network showed that the creation of the call took less than 20 minutes and cost only $1 to make. New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella said in a statement that he hoped the indictments will ""send a strong deterrent signal to anyone who might consider interfering with elections, whether through the use of artificial intelligence or otherwise."" In January, a spokesperson for Congressman Dean Phillips, who was primarying Mr. Biden for the Democratic nomination and spent most of his time campaigning in New Hampshire, said the campaign had no involvement with the robocall. After an NBC report detailed Kramer's work for the Phillips campaign assisting with ballot access, a spokesperson said Kramer created the call ""of his own volition"" and said they ""absolutely denounce his actions."" ""This case is a canary in the coal mine,"" Phillips told CBS News in a statement Thursday evening.

They see what's – it's weaponization of the Justice Department, of the FBI. And, you know, that's all coming out of Washington. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: North Dakota Governor and Trump running mate contender Doug Burgum will be here. And we will talk with former U.S. attorney Preet Bharara. Finally: The U.S. makes a major announcement, in hopes of pushing Israel to end the war with Hamas, as the Gaza humanitarian crisis continues to grow. It's all just ahead on Face the Nation. Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. The seven-week New York criminal trial is over. Former President Donald Trump has been found guilty on all 34 charges against him. And he is now able to campaign freely until July 11, when he will be sentenced. That's exactly four days before he is officially nominated at the party's convention in Milwaukee. As a felon, Trump cannot own a firearm or serve in a jury, but he can vote for himself, as he can run and be elected president. But we are clearly in uncharted territory, and it will be some time before we can fully see the impact of the conviction. Our new CBS News poll finds that 57 percent of Americans think the jury reached the right verdict, with virtually the same share, 56 percent, saying he received a fair trial. As more evidence of the partisan split in America, 96 percent of Democrats said the guilty verdict was the right one. So did 56 percent of independents. But eight in 10 Republicans say the verdict was the wrong one and that the trial was not fair. Finally, half think that Trump is not fit to be president now that he's convicted, with 40 percent saying he is and 8 percent unsure. What you just heard Trump say about the case coming from Washington is not true. Charges in this case were brought by the Manhattan district attorney. It is a state case, which means an appeal would not automatically go to the Supreme Court. For analysis and context, we want to bring in our chief campaign and elections correspondent Robert Costa, who covers Trump and the entire trial for us in New York, and our chief legal correspondent, Jan Crawford, who has been covering the Supreme Court for decades, but, Jan, nothing like this ever before. Jan, can you help us to understand? Trump said he will try to appeal this conviction. What is the next step? JAN CRAWFORD: Well, I mean, as he said, you know, this is a long way from over. But there is, I think, zero chance this is going to be overturned before November. And the road ahead for Trump on appeal doesn't look too good either. As for timing, he's got 30 days to file what's called a notice of appeal. That's procedural. That could then start the process through the New York court state system, which could take over a year. Now, you said, as you pointed out in the intro, his supporters have been kind of throwing around the Supreme Court, he can involve the Supreme Court, this. But you have to go through when you're challenging a criminal conviction the state court system first. Then he would turn to try to get the Supreme Court to take the case by raising constitutional issues. As for the appeal itself that he will try to file, the lawyers throughout the trial, I think, were laying the groundwork for possible issues from start to finish, I mean, starting with the venue in heavily Democratic New York, the indictment, the charges themselves, a pretty novel legal theory, bringing in federal election law to a state case. He's going to talk about the evidence that was allowed or not allowed. He could talk about the jury instructions and certain components of that, even attacking the impartiality of the judge himself. But that is a very tough road to hoe. He's got to show this is clear reversible error. That is very difficult to do on any kind of appeal. And so, I mean, that's why people say, Bob, if you're ever in trouble, spend your money on a good trial lawyer, because, once you get into the appeals process, the odds are not good, and not good for Donald Trump here. MARGARET BRENNAN: Bob, the political impact here, obviously, we're in the early stages. But we know that Lara Trump, who is chair of the RNC, said on another network this morning they had raised $70 million in 48 hours. Is this only helpful? ROBERT COSTA: It's helpful in terms of raising money, but, for former President Trump, there is still a logistical nightmare on the horizon. When I spoke to his lawyer Todd Blanche, the – he didn't rule out the possibility that Trump could be in jail during the Republican National Convention. When sentencing happens on July 11, there's an expectation he could be put on probation. But this was a tense trial. I was there for seven weeks. When you sat inside that court, at times, the judge cleared the courtroom because he was so frustrated with the defense and one of the witnesses that was being called. Trump violated the gag order multiple times. So, Republicans, the top Republicans in this country, are privately telling me they're not ruling out the possibility that Trump could be in prison when he accepts the nomination. There's a real concern that some traditional Republicans, suburban Republicans, might look at someone being called a convicted felon and say, I really can't go there, even as it motivates so many of Trump's core supporters. MARGARET BRENNAN: But, Jan, I mean, from all the research we have done, it seems like legal experts do not believe that there will be jail time. JAN CRAWFORD: No, not in this kind of case, not in this kind of case, first-time offender whose age… MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that just a political talking point? JAN CRAWFORD: I mean, I think it would be pretty shocking to most people who followed the New York court system that he would get jail time for this. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. And that's not just because of Secret Service detail or who he is. JAN CRAWFORD: No, it's – if he's treated like other defendants facing a similar charge, again, also because of his age, he's – he would be a first-time offender. And – and the charge itself is somewhat unusual, bringing in that federal election law. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. JAN CRAWFORD: So, typically, in these kind of cases, you would have other charges, fraud charges, that could then carry jail time. So that makes this case different as well. It's just this one issue. MARGARET BRENNAN: But he does now have a criminal record. And there are three other criminal cases. Just to remind people, at – in the federal level, the special counsel has the two, one, related to national security and mishandling classified information, the other trying to change the outcome of the 2020 election. And then there's the Georgia case as well. When will the Supreme Court make a decision on whether Mr. Trump will face charges and trial ultimately for these federal cases? JAN CRAWFORD: Well, of course, you know, Trump has said he's absolutely immune from prosecution. He lost that argument in every court that has first considered it. I think he's going to lose that in the Supreme Court that he's absolutely immune. But this court does seem to think, like, on the civil side, there may be some immunity. And so they're working on that decision now. We expect it by the end of June. They have agreed to expedite this case. This case, if it were on the normal course of business, would come sometime in the fall or winter. So, Jack Smith, the special counsel, asked for a decision sometime this term. He is going to get that. The question now is whether or not he will then have time, if this case has to go back to the lower court and kind of figure out what immunity Trump does have, whether he will have time to have a trial before November. But I think this verdict does lessen the pressure on the Supreme Court and on Jack Smith to get that conviction. There is a conviction now already, and it's not going to be overturned by November. MARGARET BRENNAN: Interesting point. Bob, quickly, our polling also shows 85 percent of Republicans feel loyalty to Trump is either very or somewhat important. How's that impacting the campaign? ROBERT COSTA: People close to former President Trump tell me that he is watching very closely. Who's on television defending him? Who's going out there and really speaking out and saying Trump did not deserve to be found guilty? Who is going to rally to his side at a crisis moment? Inside the Trump campaign, this is seen a lot like the ""Access Hollywood"" moment in October 2016, which was involved, in a sense, with why this trial unfolded. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. ROBERT COSTA: And they're saying, if you're not out for Trump right now, good luck trying to get a spot in this administration should he win. MARGARET BRENNAN: Great analysis and insight from both of you. Thank you. And, Jan, you have got a busy June ahead of you. JAN CRAWFORD: Yes. (LAUGHTER) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will see more of you, I'm sure. (CROSSTALK) (LAUGHTER) MARGARET BRENNAN: And we turn now to former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara, who endorsed Alvin Bragg, the district attorney of Manhattan, in his election. He also used to work with and actually hired Trump's attorney in the case, Todd Blanche. Good morning to you Preet. PREET BHARARA (Former U.S. Attorney, Southern District of New York): Good morning. Just one quick correction. I didn't hire Todd Blanche, but I did promote him twice. And I consider both Alvin Bragg and Todd Blanche to be friends of mine. MARGARET BRENNAN: And to be – he was Mr. Trump's attorney in this trial. So, what does having this criminal record now do for Donald Trump with these other three criminal cases? PREET BHARARA: Oh. Well, so that's an interesting question. You know, there's a lot of speculation about whether or not this criminal conviction will result in a – in a incarcerated period for Donald Trump. That's up in the air. There are arguments in favor. There are arguments against. But whatever happens, the fact of this criminal conviction will be on his record, if it – if it remains, at such a time as the future criminal trials take place. And if he gets a conviction on the federal counts in the future, the fact of this conviction here, if it's still on the books, would result in a potential higher prison sentence in those future cases. So it does have a consequence, because he will now, unlike a week ago, have a criminal record. And criminal records are taken into account in meting out punishment. MARGARET BRENNAN: Important point. You said you had promoted the president's attorney when you used to work together. PREET BHARARA: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Would you promote him based on his performance in court defending Mr. Trump? PREET BHARARA: You know, it's a very easy thing that – that I do and other people do on the panel and criticize people's performances. Sometimes, it's the case that someone could do a better job at trial. Trials are difficult. And there's a lot of scrutiny here. But, sometimes, the facts and the law are what the facts of the law are. And, sometimes, terrific defense lawyers who perform very, very well lose, and, sometimes, not-good defense lawyers win because the government hasn't proven its case. So, I'm not going to take potshots at – at Todd. I – I think he could have been stronger in some of the cross-examinations. And I will leave it at that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, sentencing is July 4 – or – excuse me – July 11, four days before the convention, as we mentioned. What grounds for appeal do you think Mr. Trump has here? PREET BHARARA: So, I think they'll make a number of case – of points. You know, Donald Trump does not want to leave anything on the cutting-room floor. I think some of his arguments are nonfrivolous. I agree with what Jan said that, in the ordinary course, it's very, very difficult to get a criminal conviction overturned, but it happens. It's happened to me. It's happened to any good prosecutor's office that brings aggressive cases. Nobody has a 100 percent record on appeal. That said, it's a very low percentage. I think a number of things, including the fact that the judge didn't change the venue, the fact that the judge didn't recuse himself – I don't think those are strong, but I think those will be made. The fact that Stormy Daniels testified a bit broadly about some of the scurrilous details of their sexual encounter, they will argue were prejudicial and should not have been allowed to come in, although they opened the door to that, arguably. And then there's this sort of technical business that I'm sure causes laypeople's eyes to glaze over. And that is the degree to which the second crime, the thing that made and transformed the misdemeanor into a felony, the basis of that did not have to be decided unanimously by the jury. So, the – the further crime, the felony, was appropriate, based on the jury's decision, if there was – the falsification of the business documents was done to further or to conceal or to commit some other crime, namely, an election crime in New York, and that could have been done three different ways… MARGARET BRENNAN: Well… (CROSSTALK) PREET BHARARA: … the jury instructions, and they don't have to be unanimous on those three different ways. And that's – that's probably an issue for appeal. MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me zero in on that, because that has been something that – that Mr. Trump and his allies have talked about. PREET BHARARA: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of this case, this was about trying to manipulate an election and fraud related to that. His allies say this was just – oh, it was a paperwork thing. Somebody mislabeled this as a legal expense. How would you tell a layperson to understand this? PREET BHARARA: Yes, look, the underlying misdemeanor – and that's why it's a misdemeanor – is falsifying business records. But the reason it becomes a felony, not the most serious felony on the books in New York, but a felony that – any felony is serious – is if that crime, that misdemeanor crime was done to conceal or commit some other crime. And that other crime that the prosecutors alleged and got the convictions on was the unla – promoting someone's election by unlawful means… MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. PREET BHARARA: … either done by the falsification of other documents or committing some other tax crime or an ele – a further election fraud crime. And so the prosecution, I think, did it as well as anybody could do for laypeople, because the jury obviously was a series of laypeople, that this was a serious thing that undermined and interfered with the election in 2016. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. PREET BHARARA: And that's serious and not to be taken lightly. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you know, we're seeing some rhetoric from Republican lawmakers, including Senator Marco Rubio, who said Mr. Trump was ""held hostage, the victim of a sham political show trial, like the ones the communists used in Cuba and the Soviet Union, railing against the ruling class."" In terms of our judicial system in this country, how should someone understand a characterization like that? PREET BHARARA: Well, I think, you know, it's silly. It's completely silly. The trial and all aspects of the trial were done openly and in public. The jury selection process, someone needs to be reminded, was participated in by the Trump legal team as well. They had all the peremptory challenges that they're accorded by law. The judge, although there's some, you know, accusations made about his impartiality or lack thereof, his rulings are there to see, as other people have pointed out. He ruled in favor of the Trump team sometimes. He ruled against the Trump team sometimes. He was pretty fair and even-handed. A jury of 12 people… MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. PREET BHARARA: … who were selected and approved by both sides brought – brought in the verdict. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. PREET BHARARA: So I don't know what – what is sham about it. The rules of evidence were – were followed and complied with. So, I – I don't really know what's happening here… MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. PREET BHARARA: … other than pure partisan politics. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, yesterday, President Biden was spending time with his son Hunter. And, tomorrow, in another unusual situation our country is in, the Biden Justice Department will begin a trial in Delaware against the president's son, where Hunter faces three felony gun possession charges, maximum 25 years prison. How much hot water is he in here? PREET BHARARA: He's in substantial hot water, because he's been charged federally, just like Donald Trump is in a lot of hot water being charged in a state court. But I think an important thing to consider here, by the way, in the wake of your question about the – the accusations of this vast conspiracy by both state prosecutors and the – and the federal Justice Department that is acting in a witch-hunt fashion, in a partisan fashion to bring down the Republican Party, here, you have the son of the sitting president of the United States of America going to trial at the hands of his own Justice Department. In a million years, can anyone listening to this broadcast understand and expect that if – if Donald Trump was elected again, and a Biden holdover U.S. attorney were to indict Donald Trump Jr., that… MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. PREET BHARARA: … Donald Trump wouldn't do something about it, in the way that Joe Biden has stayed out of it? I don't think so. So that's an important thing to remember. And, also, the other thing that's happening this week… MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. PREET BHARARA: … is a continuation of the trial against Democratic senior and important Senator Bob Menendez… MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. PREET BHARARA: … by the same Justice Department that these politicians are accusing of being partisan. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Preet Bharara, thank you for your insight and analysis. We're going to have to leave it there. And Face the Nation will be back in a minute. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum. Based on our CBS News reporting, he is under serious consideration by the former president to become his running mate in this campaign. Good morning to you, Governor. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM (R-North Dakota): Good morning, Margaret. Good to be with you. MARGARET BRENNAN: It's good to have you back on Face the Nation. You just heard our polling there; 57 percent Americans think the jury reached the right verdict; 56 percent think Trump got a fair trial. A majority of Americans are unconvinced by this claim that it's all a sham. Why do you think it is? GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: Well, I think part of it, of course, polling is a point in time. And I had a chance to briefly look at some of your poll numbers this morning. And I also saw there that almost two-thirds of the respondents said they weren't paying close attention. And I understand that they're not paying close attention to the trial, because most Americans out there, you know, they've got – working Americans don't have time to watch, you know, TV all day, read every report, because they're facing all the things, you know, putting food on the table, gas in the car… MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: … all the challenges that they're facing. And I think that, as this moment in time passes, when we have the election coming this fall, people are going to make a decision about, were they better – are they better off today than they were four years ago? MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: And this is an unusual thing, that this is not – President Trump's not a candidate that's unknown or never run before. They had an opportunity to live their life under four years of him. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: And they had a chance to, you know, prosper. And they had a chance to understand what the world was like, no wars. And now that – it's a very different situation. So, I – I think, while this is – it's interesting, and it's captivating right now to a lot of people… MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: … the election is not going to turn on this trial. MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S. isn't involved in a war right now either. But in… GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: Well, we're involved in two proxy wars. MARGARET BRENNAN: We were then as well. But, on – on your point, Donald Trump spends a lot of time talking about these trials. It – it's not just journalists. And it's historic. But he talks quite a lot about it. And, in fact, he held an extensive news conference Friday with a litany of grievances against the judge, who will still have to decide on his sentencing. Personal judgment-wise, do you think that was a smart thing to do? GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: Well, I have a lot of empathy for what he must feel like, and – because as a businessperson, I – and I – someone who spent - - and I spent 30 years in tech, but a lot of that was in software that dealt with business processes. I mean, I have – I have never seen anything like this, where you can, you know, magically take, you know, a transaction that gets spread out over 11 – 11 paychecks, or paychecks – 12 vouchers, you know, 11 invoices, and, suddenly, each of those around one decision, they magically become, instead of misdemeanors, they become a felony. And if they're misdemeanor… MARGARET BRENNAN: Because of the election fraud, as – as you just heard. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: Well, but if – well, but if – if – I don't know that anybody in America – if we're asking about the voter, I don't know if anybody American can explain how a – business transaction filing errors from seven years ago become federal election law, when federal election law is not a state. This was brought in a county court. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: Federal election is federal. And I don't know the alchemy of transforming these misdemeanors, which had a two-year statute of limitations – what I'm saying, from a business perspective, CEOs around America… MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: … if you've had hundreds of millions of business filings in America in the last seven years, why aren't our courts clogged with other CEOs that were dragged in front of… MARGARET BRENNAN: If they were running for president and changing those business records to obscure donations to their own campaign – you know what I'm saying. This isn't just filing error. But… GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: Well, I – I hear what you're saying. But most Americans cannot explain it. Many – many of the legal experts… MARGARET BRENNAN: It's complicated, sure. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: Many of the legal experts that stood on the curb outside the courthouse for six years can't – for six weeks can't explain it. So Americans are going to come back to the issues that affect them, because this trial outcome doesn't affect them. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: Their – inflation affects them. MARGARET BRENNAN: It does. And I want to talk about some of those issues more in depth with you in a few minutes. We just put up a graph to – to show you our – our polling. It's two- thirds of those polled said they are watching closely. But in – in terms of, like, the bookkeeping argument, this was about a criminal conspiracy to influence an election and creating paperwork to cover it up. If the quibble is about paperwork violations, the president of the United States, his son, says, under the influence of drugs, he committed a paperwork error. That's now going to federal court because of what he did in purchasing that gun. That was a paperwork violation. Are you also offended by that? Is that also a miscarriage of justice? GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: Well, I think what's sad for America is the whole weaponization of the – the system. And what – we're going to see more of this. I mean, earlier in my life… MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think it's weaponized against Hunter Biden? GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: I think that is – is weaponized against President Trump. But if you're going to talk about equivalency in the courts, then we know that media companies have – have acknowledged that they worked in – in conjunction with the federal government to suppress information about Hunter Biden's laptop during an election year. MARGARET BRENNAN: That is not true whatsoever when it comes to this journalist or the journalists involved with this program. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: Well, then what – why were his – why were his stories about it taken down off of media companies? Why – why – why was it being suppressed during that election? Why – so – why – talk about the Steele dossier. I mean, we could go back. There – there is all kinds of things going on in our country related to election integrity. And I think, whether you're an independent, you're a Democrat, you're a Republican… MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: … we should all care about election integrity. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: And – and we – and if we want – if we want to have equivalency, then it – to make sure that we're – we have a level playing field. MARGARET BRENNAN: We have to finish this conversation on the other side of this commercial break. So let me do that and we'll finish it. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: Sure. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, stay with me, Governor. And stay with us one second. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Tune in on our streaming political show on CBS News 24/7 tomorrow. We will have a lot more from our poll on Trump's guilty verdict. America Decides airs weekdays at 5:00 p.m. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation and Governor Burgum. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We want to continue our conversation now with North Dakota Republican Governor Doug Burgum. Governor, North Dakota has tremendous energy resources. And you reportedly are helping the Trump campaign craft energy policy. That's accurate? GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM (R-ND): Well, I wouldn't say that. I'm just saying that I'm volunteering to support President Trump during this campaign because, as an energy rich state full of natural resources, and I've had the honor of being a governor under President Trump - MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: And also under President Biden. And I see the difference between the two administrations. And I've got a front row seat in understanding that the - the Biden energy policies are, you know, hard on the American consumers. They're empowering adversaries overseas and they're - they're really tough on our allies. MARGARET BRENNAN: There - there is more oil being produced in this country now than any country ever, 13 million barrels per day last year. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: Yes, and North Dakota's down and Iran is up under these policies. And the policies are built around the idea that somehow, if you shut down the U.S. energy industry, that - that that's going to be good for the environment. But when we stop production here, because it may be higher than it has been before by a little bit – MARGARET BRENNAN: It has - it is. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: But it should be much higher because we should be displacing energy coming from Venezuela, coming from Iran, coming from Russia. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let me ask you about that. Let me - let me ask you about that. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: The people that are funding the was that we're fighting are doing that on their oil sales. MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you that. Is - according to ""The Washington Post"" and their reporting, Donald Trump met with oil executives and said, if they raise a billion dollars to return him to the White House, he'll reduce regulation if elected, start auctioning off leases for drilling in - GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: I was at that meeting. I was at that meeting. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: That did not happen. That is not what happened at that meeting. And that's been reported over and over and over again. MARGARET BRENNAN: Did he ask for a billion dollars in donations? GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: He didn't ask for a billion dollars in donations, and there was no quid pro quo. I mean, think what he did last time for the energy - this guy cut regulation for everybody, whether they donated to him or not. He helped get gas prices down for all Americans, Republicans, independents and Democrats, whether they donated to him or not. It drives me crazy when - MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the economy was also shut down due to Covid, which lowered prices too. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: It drives me - when people went on - people went on hearsay that weren't at the meeting on hearsay report it like it's a fact, when it's not a fact. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I'm asking you to make sure. ""The Washington Post"" also reported that Trump suggested to those oil executives he would ease scrutiny of industry mergers and acquisitions if he wins. Do you think that the industry needs to consolidate and big oil needs to get bigger? GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: I think that the free enterprise needs to operate at ways that are efficiently to be able to compete on a global - on a global level. And what's going on in the industry – MARGARET BRENNAN: So, he would do that? GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: I'm not saying he would do that. But I tell you what - what Joe Biden's administration is doing right now, two companies want to merge, and then they come in and then they, what, they confiscate all the executives' phone numbers ahead of time, make accusations about collusions. This has never happened to another industry. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, what was promised in that meeting since you said you were there? GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: He - he didn't make promises. He listened. He went around the room for two hours asking each of the people to tell me, what are your challenges, what are you facing, what are the - what are the things - he was there learning the whole night about the challenges that we're facing. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, is he targeting the industry to finance his re- election bid? GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: I think anybody he's met with - he'll be meeting with people in Silicon Valley. He's meeting people in - across every industry. He's not targeting anybody, he's doing what candidates do, which is, you go and listen to an industry. And this industry in particular, which is the fundamental to the entire economy. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: It's not just one industry. It feeds the inflation, which is affecting every American. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: To say, what can we do to produce cleaner energy, more efficiently? President Trump talks all the time about getting oil prices down. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: Oil executives are not thrilled when he says, I'm going to get oil prices down. You know, they - they make more money when oil prices are up. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, OK. So, climate and - and environmental policy are important to young voters in particular. Are you at all concerned that you will alienate them by aligning so closely with the energy industry? GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: Well, I'm not concerned about it at all because I know in North Dakota we're - we - we are producing energy cleaner, safer and smarter than any place else in the world here in the United States - MARGARET BRENNAN: So you do want to keep some of the environmental restrictions then? GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: The environmental restrictions are hurting this country, they're not helping it. If the innovation - MARGARET BRENNAN: (INAUDIBLE). GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: People that think that you're going to solve the environmental issues with regulations, the way we solve that is with innovation. And the way we solve it with innovation is, we innovate to have zero carbon liquid fuels or low carbon liquid fuels. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: The Biden administration is on team China. They want to have every car be an EV, and then we've got to get - China controls 85 percent of the rare earth minerals. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, but they just tariff them. Would talk to you for an hour about rare earth minerals, sir. We'll have to have you come back another time to talk about that global competition. But we're going to have to leave it there and turn to one of the crises right now out of the Middle East with the Israel-Hamas conflict. Joining us is Scott Anderson. He is the director of the U.N.'s refugee efforts in Gaza. UNRWA is the largest relief agency for Palestinian refugees. And he joins us right now from Aman, Jordan. Scott, I know you were in the U.S. Army. You served two tours in Afghanistan. From what you've seen in Gaza, how does it compare? I'm sorry, I cannot hear Scott right now. SCOTT ANDERSON (Director, UNRWA Affairs Gaza): Sorry. MARGARET BRENNAN: There you go. SCOTT ANDERSON: I was going to say, Gaza is much worse, Margaret, than Afghanistan was. I mean everywhere you go, the scale of destruction just really defies description. And it looks like something out of an apocalyptic movie. Most places you're looking at 90 to 100 percent destruction with the infrastructure suffering much worse. So, I never saw anything quite like that in Afghanistan that we're seeing now in Gaza. MARGARET BRENNAN: The USAID chief, Sam Power - Samantha Power, said, conditions are worse now in Gaza than ever before. She said that was due to the Israeli military operations and closed crossings. What exactly is the humanitarian situation right now? SCOTT ANDERSON: So, what you have is 2.2 million people that have all been displaced at least once. Most have been displaced multiple times. In Rafah, ahead of the operation, we had over a million people again displaced, Khan Yunis to Karabela (ph). And what they're lacking is really just the basic necessities that we all kind of expect. They need food. They need access to water. They need access to showers, access to toilets, access to medical care. And, unfortunately, because of a variety of factors, we're unable to import everything that's needed and to make sure that everybody has the basic necessities that they need to get through every day. MARGARET BRENNAN: Nineteen different aid organizations released a letter this week saying Palestinians are surviving on less than 3 percent of their daily water needs. Hepatitis is spreading. Medical evacuations have been halted. Virtually every hospital has been issued evacuation orders. The Pentagon said it has suspended air drops of food because of the Israeli military action. And, as we know, the pier is not really operating. Who exactly is impeding the delivery? SCOTT ANDERSON: I think it's a variety of things, not just one person you can point to. All of the - the bulk of our aid comes in through Karam Shalam (ph). It all comes through Egypt. Starts at Port Saeed (ph), goes through the Siani Calarish (ph) and eventually makes its way to Karam Shalam, where it's brought in by us to the Palestinian side and then onward for the last mile distribution within Gaza. There's a lot of steps that have to go perfectly right for all that to work. And, unfortunately, not everything has gone right. For a time Egypt was not sending trucks where we had 80,000 metric tons of aid in a country we couldn't access. And - and we're - we've been perpetually playing catch- up on the aid situation since October. Not everybody has a tent that needs one. So you have people sleeping outside still as we're eight months after the start of the conflict. And you - you highlighted correctly our number one concern at this point, which is access to clean drinking water. You know, without that, in addition to hepatitis, you have things like cholera and other diseases that can become very prevalent and we could see an outbreak happen very soon. And it's something that concerns us. And, additionally, it's getting hot. You know, it's summer. It's essentially you're in the desert. And if people don't have access to clean drinking water, that's a problem for dehydration, as well as for disease. MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you are with the U.N. so you can't talk about politics and policy, but President Biden did make this address Friday talking about a proposal for a cease-fire and hostage deal. He said it would come with 600 aid trucks per day to enter Gaza with supplies, with shelter, and the like. Who's going to be doing all of that distribution? SCOTT ANDERSON: I mean that would be the entire international humanitarian community because of the scale. I mean currently, UNRWA feeds a little over half the population. We're feeding about 1.3 or 1.4 million people every day. But it would be us, along with the rest of the U.N. and all our partners. And I would say, we very much welcome a cease-fire. It's time for the hostages to go home to their families. Time for more aid to start coming in and then hopefully we can start rebuilding Gaza. MARGARET BRENNAN: Scott Anderson, thank you for telling us what you are seeing and experiencing on the ground. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by the former commander of U.S. forces in the Middle East, retired General Frank McKenzie. His new book, ""The Melting Point,"" is available this Tuesday. Good to see you, sir. GENERAL FRANK MCKENZIE (Ret., Former Commander of U.S. Central Command and Author, ""The Melting Point""): Good to be here, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, on Friday, President Biden said that Hamas is no longer capable of carrying out another October 7th. When you were last with us in February, you said Israel's success has been very limited. Do you think they can declare success now? GENERAL FRANK MCKENZIE: I think they're a lot closer than they were a few months ago. I still think Hamas political and military leadership exists largely whole. A lot of their combat formations have been destroyed. But I think Hamas has been significantly atritted (ph). MARGARET BRENNAN: You also have raised a few times in the past few months concerns about America's continued presence in the Middle East, which you say is crucial here. Right now we are seeing so many different flash points. One of them in the Red Sea, where our CBS' David Martin reported the U.S. used a 5,000 pound bunker buster bomb in Yemen just this past week. The Houthis are attacking shipping. We have concerns about the troop safety in Syria and in Iraq. Does it need to continue? GENERAL FRANK MCKENZIE: Well, I think we remain the critical nation in the Middle East. I think everybody looks at us to be the honest broker. If we take the situation with the Houthis as simply one example, I would argue that we've been too passive. We've allowed the Houthis really to dominate global maritime communications by closing down effectively the Suez Canal. And that is something that's not only bad for the United States, but for many other nations around the world. It has nothing to do actually with Israel or the conflict in Gaza. Rather, it's a larger principle for the United States. But we've essentially been catching and not pitching in this conflict despite deploying multibillion-dollar warships into the Red Sea. The sign that we're dropping larger bombs may be a good thing, but we need to go after the source of the attacks. And the source of the attacks is Houthi leadership and command and control facilities in Yemen. And I would argue that the threat of escalation is very small if we conduct these attacks. MARGARET BRENNAN: When you say we, you think the Biden administration? GENERAL FRANK MCKENZIE: I think the United States and our allies. MARGARET BRENNAN: You largely try to avoid politics and directly addressing the presidents you served under in the book that you wrote here, but you have had such a key role in some of these very significant national security decisions, killing the ISIS commander, Baghdadi, taking Qassem Soleimani off the battlefield, executing the withdrawal from Afghanistan. And you spread around some blame to past U.S. presidents. But you do point to the Doha agreement, the withdraw negotiated by the Trump administration, as one of the worst negotiating mistakes ever made by the U.S. Why? GENERAL FRANK MCKENZIE: I think it was. And it was – and also, by the way, we implemented the agreement. Had we actually stuck to the strict terms of the agreement, we might have been able to make something of it. But, in fact, we treated the Doha agreement as a schedule for us to depart Afghanistan. And that policy objective remained across two presidents, President Trump and President Biden. When, in fact, there are procedures in the Doha agreement, if we had respected them, that would require the Taliban to do certain things in return. We did not require that. And, effectively, I would argue, that the Doha agreement was the operational mechanism that killed Afghanistan, that destroyed the government of Afghanistan, because they saw we were eager to leave, regardless of cost, and that was a very important and deflating thing, I think, for the government of Afghanistan. MARGARET BRENNAN: As you point out, that was across two presidents. GENERAL FRANK MCKENZIE: Absolutely. MARGARET BRENNAN: Biden and Trump? GENERAL FRANK MCKENZIE: Margaret, I would argue that President Trump and President Biden, was (INAUDIBLE) as any two presidents in our history, but they both shared a policy objective of leaving Afghanistan, regardless really of the consequences. MARGARET BRENNAN: You wrote that you drafted resignation letters a few times, but the only time you actually came close was after that withdraw from Afghanistan and a drone strike August 29th that was intended to kill ISIS but killed civilians. If you had such strong objections, why was that the moment where you almost resigned and not others? GENERAL FRANK MCKENZIE: So, I feel it's very important that generals don't resign over policy differences. That's not good for the republic. It's not the way that our military system should work. And, historically, it's not the way it has worked back to the Korean War, back to the Second World War. Many generals - many senior generals disagreed with presidential decisions, but they did not resign. So, I did not feel it was appropriate to resign. In my particular case, if there had been discussions of charging my subordinates, that I felt it was necessary for me to actually accept part of that blame. Now, we did not do that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. You stayed on. You, in the book, talk quite a lot about conversations you had around how to implement the withdraw from Afghanistan and the planning for it, particularly with the Trump administration. At one point you say the chief of staff to President Trump, Mark Meadows, advised not to present certain options out of concern he'd choose them, like going to zero in Afghanistan. You wrote, Trump made the decision to kill Qassem Soleimani, but his national security advisors were telling him there won't be any consequences for it, which is not what U.S. intelligence said and that is not what U.S. CENTCOM thought. Why is it important for the public to know that the people around the commanders in chief were either not sharing full picture with him or changing what he was allowed to see? GENERAL FRANK MCKENZIE: Well, every president, whether it - the last - either the last two have advisors that give them all kinds of different opinions. The military input that comes in is one part of that. And that was my - and I was relentlessly focused on that. Every president also has to make political calculations, not just these two presidents, but presidents as far back as President Roosevelt in the Second World War had to balance internal U.S. political objectives with what was going on around the world. So, that's not new or unusual in these times. I think in the case of Qassem Soleimani, I think President Trump made the right decision. I do not believe ultimately we made the right decision in Afghanistan. And I've been pretty clear about that in open - in open testimony. And that goes across two presidents. MARGARET BRENNAN: But it is cherry-picking, right, information to present to the commander in chief when he has to make a call. And you write about the internessing (ph) bickering you say and finger-pointing that followed Trump political appointees at the Pentagon. You wrote about the choice of drawing down the 2,500 troops. You say you don't even know where that number came from. It was kind of arbitrary. And there was an incident in which a mysterious signed letter appeared saying withdraw from Afghanistan. And you hunted that down and it was ultimately discarded. How does something like that happen with such high consequence, and do you fear that it could happen again if there is a second Trump administration? GENERAL FRANK MCKENZIE: Well, Margaret, I think the period of time from the presidential election of 2021, until the inauguration of 2022, was a particularly dangerous time inside the Pentagon. And I believe there that that's where the U.S. military has a role to play. It's a non-political role. It's a role where we answer the orders that we're given. And, at the same time, you have political appointees inside the Pentagon, they're appointed by the president and members of his party, and they have their own objectives there. And we respond to orders from the chain of command. It's very important to know who can actually give orders and who can't give orders. A lot of people that walk around the Pentagon are not in a position to give orders. The orders flow from the president to the secretary to the combatant commanders. Everyone else has an opinion, and those opinions may actually impact the decisions that are made, but they're not in the chain of command. MARGARET BRENNAN: General, it is a fascinating read. Thank you for coming on to talk about the book. GENERAL FRANK MCKENZIE: Thanks, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now with - by Matt Pottinger, who served as deputy national security adviser in the Trump administration. He is the author of the new book ""The Boiling Moat: Urgent Steps to Defend Taiwan,"" available in July. Matt, you say the clock's ticking. Beijing has been engaged in the most comprehensive peacetime military buildup of any nation since World War II."" Are you predicting that conflict will happen either on President Biden or President Trump, if he's re-elected, on their watch? MATT POTTINGER (Former Deputy National Security Adviser and Author, ""The Boiling Moat: Urgent Steps to Defend Taiwan"": Well, what is clear is that the dictator in Beijing, Xi Jinping, intends to try to take Taiwan, to annex it, by force if necessary. We also know that this would be catastrophic for American prosperity and security. But my co-authors and I are actually quite optimistic that this is a war that can be deterred, but it means that we've got to take some steps urgently. These are workable steps. It doesn't require massive new investment. We've got the technologies we need. But Taiwan, Japan and the United States in particular, need to take the steps that we think we've laid out in the book. MARGARET BRENNAN: This week the defense secretary is in Asia. And he actually met with his Chinese defense minister counterpart. You can see it there. This is like the first meeting since 2022. Last guy disappeared. MATT POTTINGER: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: But Austin said, a fight with China is neither imminent or unavoidable. When we hear the kind of rhetoric out of Washington right now, it sounds like we are headed towards conflict. What are the things you're saying need to be done to avoid it? MATT POTTINGER: Yes. Well, for starters, we need to invest more in munitions making. OK, so one of the things that the Chinese government is looking at is, would we be able to stay in a fight more than just the first, you know, the initial battle that would be involved in taking Taiwan? If they don't think we have the industrial base - and right now we haven't optimized our industrial base to do that - we're - MARGARET BRENNAN: Even with the national security supplemental investment in (INAUDIBLE)? MATT POTTINGER: Absolutely. Look, we - we - amazingly, I don't think many Americans realize, our defense spending right now is less than half of what it was in the 1980s during the Cold War. And that was during the Reagan administration. We didn't have to go to war, partly because we put the money into that. Our military, in terms of manpower, is smaller today than it was on the eve of World War II. So, we have to put more money into it. It's - it's - but we also have to do things to optimize our defense spending so that it's not guaranteed profits, no matter how inefficient the manufacturers are. There are things that we can do to super charge our military manufacturing to take advantage of our innovative base. MARGARET BRENNAN: It's interesting to hear you and before you the general talk about the scale of the problem set facing the president of the United States and the next commander in chief. So, that's why I think it's important to have this conversation this week. You did resign from the Trump administration after the violent attack on the Capitol on January the 6th. You then testified to Congress that you feared America's national security was in harm that day. That it gave ammunition to feed a narrative that our system of government doesn't work, the U.S. is in decline. If you continue to contest an election, you're not just contesting an election, you're actually challenging the Constitution itself. Do you fear that erosion is taking place right now with what we are hearing on the campaign trail? MATT POTTINGER: Well, look, I think the perception of erosion is. I actually think the United States is incredibly strong. We have all of these advantages. The century can be ours if we don't lose our nerve. I think that - look, Election Day will be a referendum. It's the best kind of referendum. It's where the American people get to decide who the next president's going to be. I hope that the outcome is decisive so that we don't end up with either side challenging the results. But if they do, just like with the last election, the courts will determine it. We have a system in place that allows us to adjudicate the outcomes of our elections. MARGARET BRENNAN: But now you even have like the ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee coming out and repeating things that undercut our judicial system. MATT POTTINGER: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Comparing the United States to the Soviet Union? MATT POTTINGER: Yes. Well, look, there - there's no way that - MARGARET BRENNAN: What does Beijing think of that? Because it - MATT POTTINGER: Yes, look - look - well, Beijing, it's kind of an interesting moment because Beijing really relishes propaganda that is designed to discredit the United States or to cause us to doubt our - our system of government. But at the same time, you have a jury that is just convicted a president of the United States. You've also got the son of a sitting president, who's - who's now under indictment, just like you heard from Preet Bharara earlier. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. MATT POTTINGER: Beijing's propaganda can only go so far. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. MATT POTTINGER: At the end of the day, Americans, thank God, we live in a system where the American people are going to decide who their president is. They're doing - they - they have - MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. MATT POTTINGER: All the information available to them. MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will try to bring - bring it to them here. Thank you very much, Matt. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. I'm Margaret Brennan. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) ",CBSnews,US

Donald Trump joins TikTok after reversal on app he tried to ban as president,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-joins-tiktok-reversal/,"While in office, Trump took issue with the social media app being controlled by a China-based parent company, trying unsuccessfully to ban the app in the U.S. with an executive order.","Washington — Former President Donald Trump has joined TikTok, posting for the first time Saturday on the widely popular video-sharing app controlled by a Chinese parent company that he once tried to ban in the U.S. ""It's my honor,"" Trump said in the video, which features Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White, who declared that ""the president is now on TikTok."" The video, which had garnered more than 2 million likes by Sunday afternoon, features clips from Trump's attendance at the UFC match in Newark, New Jersey, on Saturday, where he was greeted by supporters after being convicted in the New York ""hush money"" trial on all 34 felony counts days earlier. While in office, Trump took issue with the social media app being controlled by a China-based parent company, trying unsuccessfully to ban the app in the U.S. with an executive order. Earlier this year, a renewed push against the app gained momentum in Congress, as lawmakers approved a foreign aid package that included a provision that required its sale within a year or a ban from U.S. app stores. But before Congress approved and President Biden signed the legislation that could lead to a ban on TikTok into law, Trump changed his tune. He argued that banning TikTok would benefit Facebook, which he called the ""true Enemy of the People."" Trump's super PAC joined TikTok last month, despite his previous views. At the time, Taylor Budowich, the CEO of MAGA Inc., said in a post on X that ""we will ensure President Trump's America First agenda is brought to every corner of the internet and every precinct of this country."" The development comes months after Mr. Biden's reelection campaign launched its own account on TikTok, despite his administration's support for the legislation that could lead to a ban. For both campaigns, the app presents an opportunity to reach young voters, who will be a key demographic in November's election.

"Burgum on Trump verdict: ""The election is not gonna turn on this trial""",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/doug-burgum-trump-trial-2024-election-face-the-nation/,"North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a contender for Donald Trump's running mate, said Sunday that November's election will not be decided by the former president's guilty conviction in the New York ""hush money"" trial.","Washington — North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, considered to be one of the contenders to be Donald Trump's running mate, said Sunday that November's election will not be decided by the former president's guilty conviction in the New York ""hush money"" trial. ""While this is interesting and it's captivating right now to a lot of people, the election is not gonna turn on this trial,"" Burgum said on ""Face the Nation"" Sunday. A Manhattan jury last week found Trump guilty of falsifying business records to conceal a $130,000 payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels to buy her silence before the 2016 presidential election. But Republicans have derided the verdict, sticking by their presumptive nominee for president and claiming that the jury was biased, although the jury was composed of seven men and five women who were all approved by both the defense and the prosecution. Burgum echoed the skepticism in the verdict, while asserting that Americans haven't been paying close attention to the trial. He argued that working Americans don't have time to keep up with the details of the trial, and he suggested that it won't have a major impact on the electorate come November. ""As this moment in time passes, when we have the election coming this fall, people are going to make a decision about, are they better off today than they were four years ago?"" Burgum said, noting that Americans already had a chance to live their lives under a Trump administration. ""Americans are gonna come back to the issues that affect them because this trial outcome doesn't affect them, the inflation affects them."" According to a CBS News poll conducted after the verdict, just over a third of Americans said they had been following the news about the Trump trial and conviction ""very closely."" The survey also found that just over half of Americans think the jury reached the right verdict and that the trial was fair, which is virtually unchanged from the portion of the country that thought Trump was guilty before the verdict. And Republicans overwhelmingly said they think that Trump was treated unfairly, a sentiment that he and his surrogates have touted for months. Burgum was among a group of Republican officials who appeared at the Manhattan courthouse in the days leading up to the verdict to support the former president. Though the North Dakota governor had launched a long-shot bid for the White House, he bowed out of the race in December and later endorsed Trump. Since then, he's become a major advocate for the former president and is thought to be among the contenders for Trump's running mate. When asked about reporting from The Washington Post that Trump met with oil executives and told them that if they raise $1 billion to help him return to the White House, he would reduce regulation and start auctioning off drilling leases, Burgum backed up the former president. ""I was at that meeting. That did not happen,"" Burgum said. ""He didn't ask for a billion dollars in donations and there was no quid pro quo."" The Washington Post also reported that Trump suggested to those oil executives he would ease scrutiny of industry, mergers and acquisitions if he wins, which Burgum also denied. But when asked what did happen at the meeting, Burgum said Trump ""went around the room for two hours, asking each of the people to tell me, what are your challenges? What are you facing? What are- what are the things that- he was there learning the whole night about the challenges that we're facing."" But Burgum insisted that Trump isn't ""targeting"" the oil industry to finance his reelection bid, although he added that current environmental restrictions are ""hurting this country.""

MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum. Based on our CBS News reporting, he is under serious consideration by the former president to become his running mate in this campaign. Good morning to you, Governor. GOV. DOUG BURGUM (R-ND): Good morning, Margaret. Good to be with you. MARGARET BRENNAN: It's good to have you back on ""Face the Nation."" You just heard our polling there. 57% Americans think the jury reached the right verdict. 56% think Trump got a fair trial. A majority of Americans are unconvinced by this claim that it's all a sham. Why do you think it is? GOV. BURGUM: Well, I think part of it, of course, polling is a point in time and I had a chance to briefly look at some of your poll numbers this morning. And I also saw there that almost two thirds of the respondents said they weren't paying close attention. And I understand that they're not paying close attention to the trial, because most Americans out there, you know, they've got- working Americans don't have time to watch, you know, TV all day, read every report, because they're facing all the things, you know, putting food on the table, gas in the car, all the challenges that they're facing. And I think that as this moment in time passes, when we have the election coming this fall, people are going to make a decision about, were they better, are they better off today than they were four years ago? And this is an unusual thing, that- this is not- President Trump's not a candidate that's unknown or never run before. They had an opportunity to live their life under four years of him. And they had a chance to, you know, prosper. And they had a chance to understand what the world was like. No wars. And now that- it's a very different situation. So I- I think well, this is- it's interesting, and it's captivating right now to a lot of people, the election is not going to turn on this trial. MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S. isn't involved in a war right now, either. But, in-- GOV. BURGUM: Well, we're involved in two proxy wars. MARGARET BRENNAN: We were then as well. But on- on your point, Donald Trump spends a lot of time talking about these trials. It- it's not just journalists. And it's historic. But he talks quite a lot about it. And, in fact, he held an extensive news conference Friday with a litany of grievances against the judge, who will still have to decide on his sentencing. Personal judgment wise, do you think that was a smart thing to do? GOV. BURGUM: Well, I have a lot of empathy for what he must feel like, and- because as a business person, I- and I- someone who spent- and I spent 30 years in tech, but a lot of that was in software that dealt with business processes, I've- I've never seen anything like this, where you can, you know, magically take, you know, a transaction that gets spread out over 11- 11 paychecks, or paychecks- 12 vouchers, you know, 11 invoices, and suddenly each of those around one decision, they magically become set of misdemeanors, they become a felony. And if they're misdemean-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Because of the election fraud. That- as you just heard. GOV. BURGUM: Well- but- I don't know that anybody in America, if we're asking about the voter, I don't know if anybody American can explain how a business transaction filing, errors from 7 years ago, become federal election law, when federal election law is not a state, this is brought in a county court. Federal election is federal. And I don't know the alchemy of transforming these misdemeanors, which had a two year statute of limitations. Well, I'm saying from a business perspective, CEOs around America, if you've had hundreds of millions of business filings in America in the last 7 years, why aren't our courts clogged with other CEOs that were dragged in front of-- MARGARET BRENNAN: If they were running for president and changing those business records to obscure donations to their own campaign- you know what I'm saying, this isn't just filing error. But-- GOV. BURGUM: Well, I- I hear what you're saying. But most Americans cannot explain it. Many of the legal experts-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Should- it's complicated. Sure. GOV. BURGUM: Many of the legal experts that stood on the curb outside the courthouse for 6 years can't- for 6 weeks, can't explain it. So Americans are going to come back to the issues that affect them because this trial outcome doesn't affect them. Their- inflation affects them-- MARGARET BRENNAN: It does. And I want to talk about some of those issues more in depth with you in a few minutes. We just put up a graph to- to show you our- our polling, it's two thirds of those polled said they are watching closely. But in- in terms of like, the bookkeeping argument, this was about a criminal conspiracy to influence an election and creating paperwork to cover it up. If the quibble is about paperwork violations, the president of the United States, his son, says, under the influence of drugs, he committed a paperwork error. That's now going to federal court because of what he did in purchasing that gun. That was a paperwork violation. Are you also offended by that? Is that also a miscarriage of justice? GOV. BURGUM: Well, I think what's sad for America is the whole weaponization of the- the system. And what we're going to see more of this, I mean, earlier in-- MARGARET BRENNAN: You think it's weaponized against Hunter Biden? GOV. BURGUM: I think that is- is weaponized against President Trump. But if you're going to talk about equivalency in the courts, then we know that media companies have- have acknowledged that they worked in- in conjunction with the federal government to suppress information about Hunter Biden's laptop during an election year. MARGARET BRENNAN: That is not true whatsoever when it comes to this journalist or the journalists involved with this program. GOV. BURGUM: Well, then why was- why were his stories about it taken down off of media companies? Why- why- why was it being suppressed during that election? Why- so- why- talking about the Steele dossier, I mean, we could go back. There- there is all kinds of things going on in our country related to election integrity, and I think whether you're an independent, you're a Democrat, you're a Republican, we should all care about election integrity. And- and we- and if we want- if we want to have equivalency, then- it- to make sure that we have a level playing field. MARGARET BRENNAN: We have to finish this conversation on the other side of this commercial break. So let me do that and we'll finish it. So stay with me, Governor, and stay with us. One second. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to ""Face the Nation."" We want to continue our conversation now with North Dakota Republican governor, Doug Burgum. Governor, North Dakota has tremendous energy resources, and you reportedly are helping the Trump campaign craft energy policy. That's accurate? GOV. BURGUM: Well, I wouldn't say that. I'm just saying that I'm volunteering to support President Trump during this campaign, because as an energy rich state full of natural resources. And I've had the honor of being a governor under President Trump and also under President Biden. And I see the difference between the two administrations. And I've got a front row seat in understanding that the- the Biden energy policies are, you know, hard on the American consumers, they're empowering adversaries overseas, and they're really tough on our allies. MARGARET BRENNAN: There- there is more oil being produced in this country now than any country ever. 13 million barrels per day last year. GOV. BURGUM: Yeah, and North Dakota is down and Iran is up under these policies. And the policies are built around the idea that somehow if you shut down the U.S. energy industry, that- that that's gonna be good for the environment. But when we stop production here, it may be higher than it has been before-- (CROSSTALK) MARGARET BRENNAN: It has- it is. GOV. BURGUM: --by a- a little bit. But it should be much higher, because we should be displacing energy coming from Venezuela-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let me ask you about that. Let me-- GOV. BURGUM: --coming from Iran, coming from Russia. MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about that. GOV. BURGUM: The people that are funding the wars that we're fighting are doing that on their oil sales. (END CROSSTALK) MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you that. Is- according to the ""Washington Post,"" and their reporting, Donald Trump met with oil executives and said, if they raise a billion dollars to return him to the White House, he'll reduce regulation if elected, start auctioning off leases for drilling-- GOV. BURGUM: I was at- I was at that meeting, that did not happen. That is not what happened at that meeting. And that's been reported over and over and over again-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Did he ask for a billion dollars in donations? GOV. BURGUM: He didn't ask for a billion dollars in donations, and there was no quid pro quo. I mean, think what he did last time for the energy- this guy cut regulation for everybody, whether they donated to him or not, he helped get gas prices down for all Americans, Republicans, independents and Democrats, whether they donated to him or not-- (CROSSTALK) MARGARET BRENNAN: Well-- GOV. BURGUM: --drives me crazy-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --the economy was also shut down-- GOV. BURGUM: --what- prices- the people went on- MARGARET BRENNAN: --due to covid- lower prices-- GOV. BURGUM: --people went to hearsay- that weren't at the meeting, on hearsay, report it like it's a fact, when it's not a fact. (END CROSSTALK) MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I'm asking you to make sure. The ""Washington Post"" also reported that Trump suggested to those oil executives he would ease scrutiny of industry, mergers and acquisitions if he wins. Do you think that the industry needs to consolidate and Big Oil needs to get bigger? GOV. BURGUM: I think that the- free enterprise needs to operate in ways that are efficiently to be able to compete on a global- on a global level and what's going on in the industry-- MARGARET BRENNAN: So he would do that. GOV. BURGUM: I'm not saying he would do that. But I tell you what- what Joe Biden's administration is doing right now. Two companies want to merge. And then they come in and then they, what, they confiscate all the executives' phone numbers ahead of time, make accusations about collusions. This has never happened to another industry. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, what was promised in that meeting, since you said you were there? GOV. BURGUM: He- he didn't make promises. He- listen, he went around the room for two hours, asking each of the people to tell me, what are your challenges? What are you facing? What are- what are the things that- he was there learning the whole night about the challenges that we're facing. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, is he targeting the industry to- to finance his reelection bid? GOV. BURGUM: I think anybody he's met with, he'll be meeting with people in Silicon Valley, he's meeting people in- across every industry. He's not targeting anybody. He's doing what candidates do, which is, you go and listen to an industry, and this industry in particular, which is the fundamental to the entire economy. It's not just one industry, it feeds the inflation which is affecting every American, to say, what can we do to produce cleaner energy more efficiently? President Trump talks all the time about getting oil prices down. Oil executives are not thrilled when he says, I'm going to get oil prices down. You know, they- they make more money when oil prices are up. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, so, climate and environmental policy are important to young voters in particular. Are you at all concerned that you will alienate them by aligning so closely with the energy industry? GOV. BURGUM: Well, I'm not concerned about it at all because I know in North Dakota, we're- we- we are producing energy cleaner, safer and smarter than anyplace else in the world here in the United States. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you do want to keep some of the environmental restrictions, then? GOV. BURGUM: The environmental restrictions are hurting this country, they're not helping it. If innovation- reg- people who think that you're going to solve the environmental issues with regulations, the way we solve that is with innovation. And the way we solve it with innovation is we innovate to have zero carbon liquid fuels or low carbon liquid fuels. The Biden administration is on Team China, they want to have every car be an EV. And then we got to get- China controls 85% of the rare earth minerals. MARGARET BRENNAN: But- but they just tariffed them- would talk to you for an hour about rare earth minerals, Sir, we'll have to have you come back another time to talk about that global competition. But we're gonna have to leave it there. ",CBSnews,US

MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now with- by Matt Pottinger, who served as Deputy National Security Adviser in the Trump administration. He is the author of the new book, ""The Boiling Moat: Urgent Steps to Defend Taiwan,"" available in July. Matt, you say the clock's ticking. Beijing has been engaged in the most comprehensive peacetime military buildup of any nation since World War II. Are you predicting that conflict will happen either on President Biden, or Pres- President Trump if he's reelected, on their watch? FORMER DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR OF THE UNITED STATES, MATTHEW POTTINGER: Well, what is clear is that the dictator in Beijing, Xi Jinping, intends to try to take Taiwan, to annex it by force if necessary. We also know that this would be catastrophic for American prosperity and security. But my co-authors and I are actually quite optimistic that this is a war that can be deterred. But it means that we've got to take some steps urgently. These are workable steps. It doesn't require massive new investment. We've got the technologies we need. But Taiwan, Japan, and the United States in particular, need to take the steps that we think we've laid out in the book. MARGARET BRENNAN: The- this week, the Defense Secretary is in Asia and he actually met with his Chinese Defense Minister counterpart. You can see it there. This is, like, the first meeting since 2022. Last guy disappeared. But Austin said, ""a fight with China is neither imminent. . . or unavoidable."" When we hear the kind of rhetoric out of Washington right now, it sounds like we are headed towards conflict. What are the things you're saying need to be done to avoid it? POTTINGER: Yeah, well, for starters, we need to invest more in munitions making. Okay, so one of the things that the Chinese government is looking at is, would we be able to stay in a fight more than just the first, you know, the initial battle that would be involved in taking Taiwan? If they don't think we have the industrial base, and right now, we haven't optimized our industrial base to do that-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Even with the National Security Supplemental investment in the can? POTTINGER: Absolutely. Look, we- we- amazingly, I don't think many Americans realize, our defense spending right now is less than half of what it was in the 1980s during the Cold War. And that was during the Reagan administration. We didn't have to go to war, partly because we put the money into that. Our military in terms of manpower is smaller today than it was on the eve of World War II. So we have to put more money into it, it's- but we also have to do things to optimize our defense spending so that it's not guaranteed profits, no matter how inefficient the manufacturers are. There are things that we can do to supercharge our- our military manufacturing to take advantage of our innovative base. MARGARET BRENNAN: It's interesting to hear you, and before you, the general, talk about the scale of the problem set facing the president of the United States and the next commander in chief. So that's why I think it's important to have this conversation this week. You did resign from the Trump administration after the violent attack on the Capitol on January the 6th, you then testified to Congress that you feared America's national security was in harm that day, that it gave ""ammunition to feed a narrative that our system of government doesn't work,"" the U.S. is in decline. ""If you continue to contest an election, you're not just contesting an election,"" ""you're actually challenging the Constitution itself."" Do you fear that erosion is taking place right now with what we are hearing on the campaign trail? POTTINGER: Well look, I- I think the perception of erosion is- I actually think the United States is incredibly strong. We have all of these advantages, the- this century can be ours if we don't lose our nerve. I- I think that, look, Election Day will be a referendum. It's the best kind of referendum. It's where the American people get to decide who the next president's going to be. I hope that the outcome is decisive so that we don't end up with either side challenging the results. But if they do, just like with the last election, the- the courts will- will determine it. We have a system in place that allows us to adjudicate the outcomes of our election. MARGARET BRENNAN: But now you even have, like, the ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee coming out and repeating things that undercut our judicial system, comparing the United States to the Soviet Union? POTTINGER: Yeah, well, look, there- there- there's no way-- MARGARET BRENNAN: What does Beijing think of that? POTTINGER: Yeah, look, look, well- Beijing- it's kind of an interesting moment, because Beijing really relishes propaganda that is designed to discredit the United States, or to cause us to doubt our- our system of government. But at the same time, you have a- a jury that has just convicted a president of the United States, you- you've also got the- the son of a sitting president who's- who's now under indictment, just like you heard from Preet Bharara earlier. Beijing's propaganda can only go so far. At the end of the day, Americans- thank God we live in a system where the American people are going to decide who their president is. They- they have all the information available to them. MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will try to bring- bring it to them here. Thank you very much, Matt. We'll be right back. ",CBSnews,US
"Transcript: Scott Anderson, director of UNRWA Affairs in Gaza, on ""Face the Nation,"" June 2, 2024",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/scott-anderson-unrwa-affairs-gaza-face-the-nation-transcript-06-02-2024/,"The following is a transcript of an interview with Scott Anderson, director of UNRWA Affairs in Gaza, on ""Face the Nation"" that aired on June 2, 2024.","The following is a transcript of an interview with Scott Anderson, director of UNRWA Affairs in Gaza, on ""Face the Nation"" that aired on June 2, 2024. MARGARET BRENNAN: Joining us is Scott Anderson. He is the director of the UN's refugee efforts in Gaza. UNRWA is the largest relief agency for Palestinian refugees and he joins us right now from Amman, Jordan. Scott, I know you were in the U.S. Army, you served two tours in Afghanistan. From what you've seen in Gaza, how does it compare? Sorry, I cannot hear Scott right now. DIRECTOR OF UNRWA AFFAIRS GAZA, SCOTT ANDERSON: Sorry, I was gonna say Gaza is much worse, Margaret, than Afghanistan was. I mean, everywhere you go the scale of destruction just really defies description and it looks like something out of a- a post-apocalyptic movie. Most places you're looking at 90 to 100% destruction with the infrastructure suffering much worse. So I never saw anything quite like that in Afghanistan that we're seeing now in Gaza. MARGARET BRENNAN: The USAID chief Sam Power- Samantha Power, said conditions are worse now in Gaza than ever before. She said that was due to the Israeli military operations and closed crossings. What exactly is the humanitarian situation right now? ANDERSON: So what you have is 2.2 million people that have all been displaced at least once. Most have been displaced multiple times. In Rafah ahead of the operation, we had over a million people again displaced to Khan Younis, to Deir al-Balah. And what they're lacking is really just basic necessities that we all kind of expect. They need food, they need access to water, they need access to showers, access to toilets, access to medical care. And unfortunately, because of a variety of factors, we're unable to import everything that's needed, and to make sure that everybody has the basic necessities that they need to get through every day. MARGARET BRENNAN: Nineteen different aid organizations released a letter this week saying Palestinians are surviving on less than 3% of their daily water needs. Hepatitis is spreading. Medical evacuations have been halted. Virtually every hospital has been issued evacuation orders. The Pentagon said it has suspended airdrops of food because of the Israeli military action and as we know the pier is not really operating. Who exactly is impeding the delivery? ANDERSON: I mean, I think it's a variety of things, not just one person that you can point to. All- the bulk of our aid comes in through Kerem Shalom. It all comes through Egypt, starts at Port Said, goes through the Sinai to El-Arish, and eventually makes its way to Kerem Shalom, where it's brought in and by us to the Palestinian side and then onward for the last final distribution within Gaza. There's a lot of steps that have to go perfectly right for all that to work and unfortunately, not everything has gone right. For a time, Egypt was not sending trucks. Where we had 80,000 metric tons of aid on- in- in country we couldn't access. And we're- we've been perpetually playing catch up on the aid situation since October. Not everybody has a tent that needs one so you have people sleeping outside still as we're eight months after the start of the conflict. And you- you highlighted correctly our number one concern at this point, which is access to clean drinking water. You know, without that, in addition to hepatitis, you have things like cholera and other diseases that can become very prevalent. We could see an outbreak happen very soon and it's something that concerns us. And additionally, it's getting hot, you know, it's summer, it's- essentially you're in a desert. And if people don't have access to clean drinking water, that's a problem for dehydration, as well as for disease. MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you- you are with the UN so you can't talk about politics and policy, but President Biden did make this address Friday talking about a proposal for a cease-fire and hostage deal. He said it would come with 600 aid trucks per day to enter Gaza, with supplies with shelter and the like, who's going to be doing all of that distribution? ANDERSON: I mean, it'd be the entire international humanitarian community because of the scale. I mean, currently UNRWA feeds a little over half the population. We're feeding about 1.3 or 1.4 million people every day, but it would be us, along with the rest of the UN and all our partners and I would say we very much welcome a cease-fire. It's time for the hostages to go home to their families. Time for more aid to start coming in and then hopefully we can start rebuilding Gaza. MARGARET BRENNAN: Scott Anderson, thank you for telling us what you are seeing and experiencing on the ground. We'll be right back. ",CBSnews,US
"Transcript: Preet Bharara, former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, on ""Face the Nation,"" June 2, 2024",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/preet-bharara-face-the-nation-transcript-06-02-2024/,"The following is a transcript of an interview with Preet Bharara, former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, on ""Face the Nation"" that aired on June 2, 2024.","The following is a transcript of an interview with Preet Bharara, former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, on ""Face the Nation"" that aired on June 2, 2024. MARGARET BRENNAN: And we turn now to former US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara, who endorsed Alvin Bragg, the District Attorney of Manhattan in his election. He also used to work with, and actually hired, Trump's attorney in the case, Todd Blanche. Good morning to you Preet. PREET BHARARA: Good morning. I just want a quick correction. I didn't hire Todd Blanche, but I did promote him twice. And I consider both Alvin Bragg and Todd Blanche to be friends of mine. MARGARET BRENNAN: And to be- he was Mr. Trump's attorney in this trial. So what does having this criminal record now do for Donald Trump with these other three criminal cases? BHARARA: Well, so that's an interesting question. You know, there's a lot of speculation about whether or not this criminal conviction will result in a- in a incarcerated period for Donald Trump. That's up in the air, there are arguments in favor, there are arguments against. But whatever happens, the fact of this criminal conviction will be on his record if it- if it remains. At such a time as the future criminal trials take place, and if he gets a conviction on the federal counts in the future, the fact of this conviction here, if it's still on the books, would result in a potential higher prison sentence in those future cases. So it does have a consequence, because he will now, unlike a week ago, have a criminal record and criminal records are taken into account in meeting out punishment. MARGARET BRENNAN: Important point. You said you had promoted the president's attorney when you used to work together. Would you promote him based on his performance in court defending Mr. Trump? BHARARA: You know, it's a very easy thing that- that I do and other people do on the panel, and criticize people's performances. Sometimes it's the case that someone could do a better job at trial. Trials are difficult and there's a lot of scrutiny here. But sometimes the facts and the law are what the facts of the law are. And sometimes terrific defense lawyers, who performed very, very well, lose, and sometimes not good defense lawyers win because the government hasn't proven its case. So I'm not gonna take potshots at Adam. I thought- I think he could have been stronger in some of the cross examinations. And I'll leave it at that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, sentencing is July 4, excuse me, July 11, four days before the convention, as we mentioned. What grounds for appeal do you think Mr. Trump has here? BHARARA: So I think they'll make a number of key points. You know, Donald Trump does not want to leave anything on the cutting room floor. I think some of his arguments are non frivolous. I agree with what Jan said, that in the ordinary course, it's very, very difficult to get a criminal conviction overturned, but it happens. It's happened to me, it's happened to any good prosecutor's office that brings aggressive cases. Nobody has a 100% record on appeal. That said, it's a very low percentage. I think a number of things, including the fact that the judge didn't change the venue, the fact that the judge didn't recuse himself. I don't think those are strong, but I think those will be made. The fact that Stormy Daniels testified a bit broadly about some of the scurrilous details of their sexual encounter, they will argue were prejudicial and should not have been allowed to come in, although they opened the door to that, arguably. And then there's this sort of technical business that I'm sure causes lay people's eyes to glaze over. And that is the degree to which the second crime, the thing that made and transformed the misdemeanor into a felony, the basis of that did not have to be decided unanimously by the jury. So the- the further crime, the felony, was appropriate, based on the jury's decision, if there was- the falsification of the business documents was done to further or to conceal or to commit some other crime, namely, an election crime in New York, and that could have been done three different ways. MARGARET BRENNAN: But-- BHARARA: --Jury instructions, and they don't have to be unanimous on those three different ways. And that's- that's probably an issue for appeal. MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me zero in on that, because that has been something that- that Mr. Trump and his allies have talked about. In terms of this case, this was about trying to manipulate an election and fraud related to that. His allies say this was just, it was a paperwork thing, somebody mislabeled this as a legal expense. How would you tell the lay person to understand this? BHARARA: Look, the underlying misdemeanor and that's why it's a misdemeanor, is falsifying business records. But the reason it becomes a felony, not the most serious felony on the books in New York, but a felony that any felony is serious, is if that crime, that misdemeanor crime was done to conceal or commit some other crime and that other crime that the prosecutors alleged and got the convictions on, was the unla- promoting someone's election by unlawful means. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. BHARARA: Either done by the falsification of other documents or committing some other tax crime or in further election fraud crime. And so the prosecution, I think, did it as well as anybody could do for lay people because the jury obviously was a series of lay people. But this was a serious thing that undermined and interfered with the election in 2016. And that's serious and not to be taken lightly. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you know, we're seeing some rhetoric from Republican lawmakers, including Senator Marco Rubio, who said Mr. Trump was held hostage, the victim of a sham political show trial, like the ones the communists used in Cuba and the Soviet Union, railing against the ruling class. In terms of our judicial system in this country, how should someone understand a characterization like that? BHARARA: Well, I think you know, it's silly. It's completely silly. The trial, and all aspects of the trial were done openly and in public. The jury selection process, someone needs to be reminded, was participated in by the Trump legal team as well. They had all the peremptory challenges that they're accorded by law. The judge, although there's some, you know, accusations made about his impartiality, or lack thereof, his rulings are there to see, as other people have pointed out. He ruled in favor of the Trump team sometimes, he ruled against the Trump team sometimes. He was pretty fair and even handed. A jury of 12 people-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --Yeah-- BHARARA: --Who were selected and approved by both sides brought- brought in the verdict. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. BHARARA: So I don't know what- what a sham about it. The rules of evidence were followed and complied with. So I don't really know what's happening here. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. BHARARA: Other than pure partisan politics. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, yesterday, President Biden was spending time with his son, Hunter. And tomorrow, in another unusual situation our country is in, the Biden Justice Department will begin a trial in Delaware against the president's son where Hunter faces three felony gun possession charges, maximum 25 years prison. How much hot water is he in here? BHARARA: He's in substantial hot water, because he's been charged federally, just like Donald Trump is in a lot of hot water being charged in a state court. But I think an important thing to consider here, by the way, in the wake of your question about the- the accusations of this vast conspiracy by both state prosecutors and the- and the federal Justice Department that is acting in a witch hunt fashion, in a partisan fashion to bring down the Republican Party. Here you have the son of the sitting President of the United States of America going to trial at the hands of his own Justice Department. In a million years, can anyone listening to this broadcast understand and expect that if- if Donald Trump was elected again, and a Biden holdover US attorney were to indict Donald Trump Jr., that Donald Trump wouldn't do something about it in the way that Joe Biden has stayed out of it? I don't think so. So that's an important thing to remember. And also, the other thing that's happening this week is a continuation of the trial against Democratic senior and important Senator Bob Menendez-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --Yes-- BHARARA: --By the same Justice Department that these politicians are accusing of being partisan. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Preet Bharara, thank you for your insight and analysis. We're gonna have to leave it there. And Face the Nation will be back in a minute. ",CBSnews,US
Trump's guilty verdict: A stress test for democracy,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trumps-guilty-verdict-a-stress-test-for-democracy/,"Being found guilty of 34 felony counts would normally mark the end of someone's political prospects. But this week's conviction is not stopping Trump (who has built his career, and brand, on grievances) from running for another term in the White House.","Historic … unprecedented … and guilty. You couldn't escape those words this past week, after a former President of the United States was convicted on 34 felony counts in New York, a city he long called home. But beyond all the drama, said CBS News legal contributor Rebecca Roiphe, was simply a jury of seven men and five women doing their duty – and honoring the dictum, ""Nobody is above the law."" ""You can have all sorts of power, you can have all sorts of wealth, but when you're in that courtroom, you're just like anybody else,"" said Roiphe. ""Of course, there are some people who are going to look at this case and not look at it that way."" Donald Trump is one of them. ""It was a rigged trial,"" he claimed a day after he was found guilty. ""We wanted a venue change where we could have a fair trial. We didn't get it."" President Joe Biden, meanwhile, defended the legal system. ""The jury heard five weeks of evidence,"" he said Friday. ""They found Donald Trump guilty on all 34 felony counts. Now he'll be given the opportunity – as he should – to appeal that decision."" The gravity of this moment is obvious – a stress test for democracy, just as the Trump-Biden race is heating up. Less obvious is what happens next. For example, can a convicted felon still serve as president? ""Yes,"" said Roiphe. ""We have certain limitations [in the Constitution] on the presidency, and that is not one of them. ... There's nothing barring somebody from either running for the presidency, or for being president, as a convicted felon."" Trump is scheduled to be sentenced on July 11, days before Republicans are set to nominate him again. Trump attorney Todd Blanche admits it's possible his client could be in jail while the Republican National Convention is being held: ""That's something that I don't want to think about,"" he said Friday. ""I don't think it's going to happen. But it's possible, of course."" Regardless, the summer – with its debates, conventions, and other political fireworks – is likely to be a season of Trump's grievance. Trump's campaign says it raised more than $50 million 24 hours after the guilty verdict. And Trump has kept top Republicans at his side (some showing up in court, in loyal red ties) at his side. Author Michael Wolff covered the trial, and has written several books on Trump. ""This is a campaign, and this is a political career based on conflict, conflict, conflict, conflict,"" said Wolff. ""Other politicians are going to go running away from conflict. He's running absolutely toward it. ""The fact that this person keeps going against these things that no one could shoulder, somehow – weirdly – makes him heroic to many, many, many, many people,"" Wolff said. For Wolff, this crossroads is a reckoning of Trump – and of the combative New York world of infamous lawyers and fixers, hush money, and tabloids Trump has now made our own. Costa asked Wolff, ""As a longtime observer and writer on Trump, what do you make of him, someone who forged his career in the '70s and '80s alongside a New York lawyer like Roy Cohn, now finding himself a convicted felon in Lower Manhattan?"" ""I mean, it almost is poetic,"" Wolff replied. ""If you were a writer and you were writing this story, this is how you might have it end. The anomaly is that this is not necessarily where it ends, that it may well end in the White House."" For more info: Story produced by David Rothman. Editor: Chad Cardin.

Simone Biles wins 9th U.S. Championships title ahead of Olympic trials,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/simone-biles-us-championships-title-2024/,Gymnastics superstar Simone Biles won her ninth national title ahead of the Olympic trials later this month in Minneapolis​.,"Gymnastics superstar Simone Biles won her ninth U.S. Championship on Sunday, leaving little doubt that at 27 and a decade-plus into her run atop the sport, she is as good as ever. Biles posted a two-day all-around total of 119.750, nearly six points clear of runner-up Skye Blakely and leaving little doubt that she appears ready to add a second all-around Olympic gold to go with the one she captured in 2016. In front of an audience that included her husband, Chicago Bears safety Jonathan Owens, Biles put on a four-rotation clinic that featured all the trademarks of a typical Biles performance. There was jaw-dropping athleticism mixed with precision and more than a splash of swagger. Biles finished with the highest two-day score on all four events — something she'd done only once before at nationals (2018) — to build plenty of momentum ahead of the Olympic trials later this month in Minneapolis. Her only misstep on Sunday came on vault. She came up short on her Yurchenko double pike — two back flips with her hands clasped behind her knees — during warmups and overcompensated when it counted, generating so much force she wound up on her back. She still received a 15.000 for her effort, a testament to a vault that's never been completed in competition by another woman and only attempted by a select group of men. Not that it bothered her. Biles collected herself, took a couple of deep breaths then followed it up a Cheng vault that was rewarded with a 15.1 and put a ninth national title within reach, heady territory considering no other gymnast in the history of the sport in the U.S. has more than seven. While Biles remains above the fray as usual, there is plenty of competition for the other four spots on the five-woman U.S. team that will head to Paris as heavy favorites to return to the top of the podium after finishing second to Russia in Tokyo three years ago. Blakely, 19, put together another impressive performance and will head to Minneapolis with plenty of momentum. Three years after her bid to make the 2020 Olympic team ended with an injury, Blakely is peaking at the right time. Suni Lee, the 2020 Olympic champion who has spent the last year-plus battling kidney issues that have limited her training, shook off an early mistake on vault to put together elegant routines on uneven bars and balance beam that few in the world — even Biles — can match. Olympians Jordan Chiles and Jade Carey are in the mix, though both endured falls on beam on Sunday. Third-place finisher Kayla DiCello slipped off the uneven bars. Leanne Wong, perhaps looking fatigued after a long season competing at Florida, also endured uncharacteristic miscues. Shilese Jones, considered the best all-around gymnast in the U.S. without the last name Biles, pulled out of the championships on Friday, citing a shoulder injury though she said Sunday she was feeling better and plans to be available for trials. So will 18-year-old Kaliya Lincoln, who opted not to compete on Sunday after tweaking something during Friday night's opening session. Both — if healthy — figure to be serious contenders to earn an invitation to Paris (Jones in particular). If they're not, the door could swing wide open for others and test the depth the senior elite program has been touting for years. ",CBSnews,US
Arizona tribe temporarily bans dances after police officer shot dead,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/arizona-tribe-bans-dances-police-officer-shot-gila-river-indian-community/,The Gila River Indian Community issued a temporary ban on dances after a police officer was fatally shot and another wounded while responding to a reported disturbance.,"The Gila River Indian Community has issued a temporary ban on dances after a tribal police officer was fatally shot and another wounded while responding to a reported disturbance at a Santan home, tribal officials said Sunday. Stephen Roe Lewis, governor of the tribe south of Phoenix, said a special meeting of community council's leaders was held Saturday night. The council approved a temporary moratorium on all permitted and non-permitted dances in the community, effective immediately, along with enhanced penalties for trespassing and disorderly conduct, he said. The Phoenix FBI and Gila River Police Department will conduct a joint investigation of the shooting, though many details have not yet been released. The Arizona Republic reported that the shooting occurred at a teenager's birthday party in Santan, located in one of the tribal community's seven districts. Joshua Briese, who had been with the Gila River Police Department for less than a year and had not completed field training, responded to the scene along with another tribal police officer around 2 a.m. Saturday on a 911 disturbance call involving a large crowd. Police said multiple gunshots were fired and both officers were struck, with four other people wounded. Briese was declared dead at a hospital, and the other officer, whose name hasn't been released yet, was listed in serious but stable condition, according to police. One of the four people wounded later died, police said. The names of the victims weren't immediately available Sunday. ""We extend our deepest condolences to his family, friends and colleagues,"" the FBI Phoenix said in a statement Saturday. ""Our hearts and prayers are with these police officers, their families, and everyone impacted by this tragic incident,"" Gila River police said. Briese, 23, was the son of a former sheriff's deputy in Montana who also died in the line of duty. The Yellowstone County Sheriff's Office said in a Facebook post that David Briese was killed in a November 2006 car crash. News reports said David Briese was responding at the time to a backup call for an officer who was dealing with a combative impaired driver in Billings, Montana. ",CBSnews,US
Rupert Murdoch marries for 5th time in ceremony at California vineyard,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rupert-murdoch-marries-5th-time-elena-zhukova/,"Media magnate Rupert Murdoch, who is 93, married Elena Zhukova on Saturday.","Rupert Murdoch, 93, has married for the fifth time, his corporation, News Corp, confirmed Sunday. Murdoch, the media mogul who recently stepped down as chairman of Fox News and News Corp, married Elena Zhukova, a 67-year-old Russian-born retired molecular biologist, on Saturday in a ceremony at his vineyard estate in Bel Air, California. Photographs of the newly married couple were released by News Corp. The couple announced their engagement in March. Zhukova studied at the University of California, Los Angeles, according to a New York Times report in March. In her career as a molecular biologist, she focused on diabetes. Zhukova is also the ex-wife of Alexander Zhukov, a billionaire energy investor and Russian politician. Their daughter, Dasha, was previously married to Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, who used to own the Premier League soccer club Chelsea. Abramovich was an early target of Western sanctions after the Kremlin first invaded Ukraine in 2022. After Murdoch stepped down as leader of both Fox News' parent company and his News Corp media holdings, his son, Lachlan, took his place in a media empire that spans continents and helped to shape modern American politics. Murdoch, whose net worth is pegged at $9.77 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, has been married four times before. Most recently, he was engaged to retired dental hygienist Ann Lesley Smith, whom he never married. He was previously married to model Jerry Hall, whom he divorced in the summer of 2022. His first three wives include Patricia Booker, Anna Murdoch Mann, and Wendi Murdoch. In 1952, Murdoch inherited a newspaper in his native Australia from his father. Over decades, he built a news and entertainment enterprise that became prominent in the United States and Britain, including ownership of such notable newspapers as The Times of London and The Wall Street Journal. Fox News Channel, the 24-hour network founded in 1996, has profoundly influenced television, becoming a popular news source among many conservative U.S. audiences and politicians. ",CBSnews,US

MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington. And this week on Face the Nation: With former President Trump now officially a convicted felon, how will that impact campaign 2024? Donald Trump was among the faithful when he dropped in on the Saturday night Ultimate Fighting Championship in New Jersey last night. (Begin VT) ANNOUNCER: Boy, the round of applause he's getting right now is pretty staggering. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: But what do voters think of the Trump conviction outside the UFC? We have got early reaction from across America, and we will tell you what's ahead on the legal front. (Begin VT) DONALD TRUMP (Former President of the United States (R) and Current U.S. Presidential Candidate): So we're going to be appealing this scam. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Plus, how's the outcome of the case playing with the parties? For Democrats, it's a defense of the judicial system. (Begin VT) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: And it's reckless, it's dangerous, and it's irresponsible for anyone to say this was rigged just because they don't like the verdict. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: And the Republican refrain? Attack it. (Begin VT) FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The Republican Party has really – they have stuck. They stick together in this. They see what's – it's weaponization of the Justice Department, of the FBI. And, you know, that's all coming out of Washington. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: North Dakota Governor and Trump running mate contender Doug Burgum will be here. And we will talk with former U.S. attorney Preet Bharara. Finally: The U.S. makes a major announcement, in hopes of pushing Israel to end the war with Hamas, as the Gaza humanitarian crisis continues to grow. It's all just ahead on Face the Nation. Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. The seven-week New York criminal trial is over. Former President Donald Trump has been found guilty on all 34 charges against him. And he is now able to campaign freely until July 11, when he will be sentenced. That's exactly four days before he is officially nominated at the party's convention in Milwaukee. As a felon, Trump cannot own a firearm or serve in a jury, but he can vote for himself, as he can run and be elected president. But we are clearly in uncharted territory, and it will be some time before we can fully see the impact of the conviction. Our new CBS News poll finds that 57 percent of Americans think the jury reached the right verdict, with virtually the same share, 56 percent, saying he received a fair trial. As more evidence of the partisan split in America, 96 percent of Democrats said the guilty verdict was the right one. So did 56 percent of independents. But eight in 10 Republicans say the verdict was the wrong one and that the trial was not fair. Finally, half think that Trump is not fit to be president now that he's convicted, with 40 percent saying he is and 8 percent unsure. What you just heard Trump say about the case coming from Washington is not true. Charges in this case were brought by the Manhattan district attorney. It is a state case, which means an appeal would not automatically go to the Supreme Court. For analysis and context, we want to bring in our chief campaign and elections correspondent Robert Costa, who covers Trump and the entire trial for us in New York, and our chief legal correspondent, Jan Crawford, who has been covering the Supreme Court for decades, but, Jan, nothing like this ever before. Jan, can you help us to understand? Trump said he will try to appeal this conviction. What is the next step? JAN CRAWFORD: Well, I mean, as he said, you know, this is a long way from over. But there is, I think, zero chance this is going to be overturned before November. And the road ahead for Trump on appeal doesn't look too good either. As for timing, he's got 30 days to file what's called a notice of appeal. That's procedural. That could then start the process through the New York court state system, which could take over a year. Now, you said, as you pointed out in the intro, his supporters have been kind of throwing around the Supreme Court, he can involve the Supreme Court, this. But you have to go through when you're challenging a criminal conviction the state court system first. Then he would turn to try to get the Supreme Court to take the case by raising constitutional issues. As for the appeal itself that he will try to file, the lawyers throughout the trial, I think, were laying the groundwork for possible issues from start to finish, I mean, starting with the venue in heavily Democratic New York, the indictment, the charges themselves, a pretty novel legal theory, bringing in federal election law to a state case. He's going to talk about the evidence that was allowed or not allowed. He could talk about the jury instructions and certain components of that, even attacking the impartiality of the judge himself. But that is a very tough road to hoe. He's got to show this is clear reversible error. That is very difficult to do on any kind of appeal. And so, I mean, that's why people say, Bob, if you're ever in trouble, spend your money on a good trial lawyer, because, once you get into the appeals process, the odds are not good, and not good for Donald Trump here. MARGARET BRENNAN: Bob, the political impact here, obviously, we're in the early stages. But we know that Lara Trump, who is chair of the RNC, said on another network this morning they had raised $70 million in 48 hours. Is this only helpful? ROBERT COSTA: It's helpful in terms of raising money, but, for former President Trump, there is still a logistical nightmare on the horizon. When I spoke to his lawyer Todd Blanche, the – he didn't rule out the possibility that Trump could be in jail during the Republican National Convention. When sentencing happens on July 11, there's an expectation he could be put on probation. But this was a tense trial. I was there for seven weeks. When you sat inside that court, at times, the judge cleared the courtroom because he was so frustrated with the defense and one of the witnesses that was being called. Trump violated the gag order multiple times. So, Republicans, the top Republicans in this country, are privately telling me they're not ruling out the possibility that Trump could be in prison when he accepts the nomination. There's a real concern that some traditional Republicans, suburban Republicans, might look at someone being called a convicted felon and say, I really can't go there, even as it motivates so many of Trump's core supporters. MARGARET BRENNAN: But, Jan, I mean, from all the research we have done, it seems like legal experts do not believe that there will be jail time. JAN CRAWFORD: No, not in this kind of case, not in this kind of case, first-time offender whose age… MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that just a political talking point? JAN CRAWFORD: I mean, I think it would be pretty shocking to most people who followed the New York court system that he would get jail time for this. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. And that's not just because of Secret Service detail or who he is. JAN CRAWFORD: No, it's – if he's treated like other defendants facing a similar charge, again, also because of his age, he's – he would be a first-time offender. And – and the charge itself is somewhat unusual, bringing in that federal election law. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. JAN CRAWFORD: So, typically, in these kind of cases, you would have other charges, fraud charges, that could then carry jail time. So that makes this case different as well. It's just this one issue. MARGARET BRENNAN: But he does now have a criminal record. And there are three other criminal cases. Just to remind people, at – in the federal level, the special counsel has the two, one, related to national security and mishandling classified information, the other trying to change the outcome of the 2020 election. And then there's the Georgia case as well. When will the Supreme Court make a decision on whether Mr. Trump will face charges and trial ultimately for these federal cases? JAN CRAWFORD: Well, of course, you know, Trump has said he's absolutely immune from prosecution. He lost that argument in every court that has first considered it. I think he's going to lose that in the Supreme Court that he's absolutely immune. But this court does seem to think, like, on the civil side, there may be some immunity. And so they're working on that decision now. We expect it by the end of June. They have agreed to expedite this case. This case, if it were on the normal course of business, would come sometime in the fall or winter. So, Jack Smith, the special counsel, asked for a decision sometime this term. He is going to get that. The question now is whether or not he will then have time, if this case has to go back to the lower court and kind of figure out what immunity Trump does have, whether he will have time to have a trial before November. But I think this verdict does lessen the pressure on the Supreme Court and on Jack Smith to get that conviction. There is a conviction now already, and it's not going to be overturned by November. MARGARET BRENNAN: Interesting point. Bob, quickly, our polling also shows 85 percent of Republicans feel loyalty to Trump is either very or somewhat important. How's that impacting the campaign? ROBERT COSTA: People close to former President Trump tell me that he is watching very closely. Who's on television defending him? Who's going out there and really speaking out and saying Trump did not deserve to be found guilty? Who is going to rally to his side at a crisis moment? Inside the Trump campaign, this is seen a lot like the ""Access Hollywood"" moment in October 2016, which was involved, in a sense, with why this trial unfolded. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. ROBERT COSTA: And they're saying, if you're not out for Trump right now, good luck trying to get a spot in this administration should he win. MARGARET BRENNAN: Great analysis and insight from both of you. Thank you. And, Jan, you have got a busy June ahead of you. JAN CRAWFORD: Yes. (LAUGHTER) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will see more of you, I'm sure. (CROSSTALK) (LAUGHTER) MARGARET BRENNAN: And we turn now to former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara, who endorsed Alvin Bragg, the district attorney of Manhattan, in his election. He also used to work with and actually hired Trump's attorney in the case, Todd Blanche. Good morning to you Preet. PREET BHARARA (Former U.S. Attorney, Southern District of New York): Good morning. Just one quick correction. I didn't hire Todd Blanche, but I did promote him twice. And I consider both Alvin Bragg and Todd Blanche to be friends of mine. MARGARET BRENNAN: And to be – he was Mr. Trump's attorney in this trial. So, what does having this criminal record now do for Donald Trump with these other three criminal cases? PREET BHARARA: Oh. Well, so that's an interesting question. You know, there's a lot of speculation about whether or not this criminal conviction will result in a – in a incarcerated period for Donald Trump. That's up in the air. There are arguments in favor. There are arguments against. But whatever happens, the fact of this criminal conviction will be on his record, if it – if it remains, at such a time as the future criminal trials take place. And if he gets a conviction on the federal counts in the future, the fact of this conviction here, if it's still on the books, would result in a potential higher prison sentence in those future cases. So it does have a consequence, because he will now, unlike a week ago, have a criminal record. And criminal records are taken into account in meting out punishment. MARGARET BRENNAN: Important point. You said you had promoted the president's attorney when you used to work together. PREET BHARARA: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Would you promote him based on his performance in court defending Mr. Trump? PREET BHARARA: You know, it's a very easy thing that – that I do and other people do on the panel and criticize people's performances. Sometimes, it's the case that someone could do a better job at trial. Trials are difficult. And there's a lot of scrutiny here. But, sometimes, the facts and the law are what the facts of the law are. And, sometimes, terrific defense lawyers who perform very, very well lose, and, sometimes, not-good defense lawyers win because the government hasn't proven its case. So, I'm not going to take potshots at – at Todd. I – I think he could have been stronger in some of the cross-examinations. And I will leave it at that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, sentencing is July 4 – or – excuse me – July 11, four days before the convention, as we mentioned. What grounds for appeal do you think Mr. Trump has here? PREET BHARARA: So, I think they'll make a number of case – of points. You know, Donald Trump does not want to leave anything on the cutting-room floor. I think some of his arguments are nonfrivolous. I agree with what Jan said that, in the ordinary course, it's very, very difficult to get a criminal conviction overturned, but it happens. It's happened to me. It's happened to any good prosecutor's office that brings aggressive cases. Nobody has a 100 percent record on appeal. That said, it's a very low percentage. I think a number of things, including the fact that the judge didn't change the venue, the fact that the judge didn't recuse himself – I don't think those are strong, but I think those will be made. The fact that Stormy Daniels testified a bit broadly about some of the scurrilous details of their sexual encounter, they will argue were prejudicial and should not have been allowed to come in, although they opened the door to that, arguably. And then there's this sort of technical business that I'm sure causes laypeople's eyes to glaze over. And that is the degree to which the second crime, the thing that made and transformed the misdemeanor into a felony, the basis of that did not have to be decided unanimously by the jury. So, the – the further crime, the felony, was appropriate, based on the jury's decision, if there was – the falsification of the business documents was done to further or to conceal or to commit some other crime, namely, an election crime in New York, and that could have been done three different ways… MARGARET BRENNAN: Well… (CROSSTALK) PREET BHARARA: … the jury instructions, and they don't have to be unanimous on those three different ways. And that's – that's probably an issue for appeal. MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me zero in on that, because that has been something that – that Mr. Trump and his allies have talked about. PREET BHARARA: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of this case, this was about trying to manipulate an election and fraud related to that. His allies say this was just – oh, it was a paperwork thing. Somebody mislabeled this as a legal expense. How would you tell a layperson to understand this? PREET BHARARA: Yes, look, the underlying misdemeanor – and that's why it's a misdemeanor – is falsifying business records. But the reason it becomes a felony, not the most serious felony on the books in New York, but a felony that – any felony is serious – is if that crime, that misdemeanor crime was done to conceal or commit some other crime. And that other crime that the prosecutors alleged and got the convictions on was the unla – promoting someone's election by unlawful means… MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. PREET BHARARA: … either done by the falsification of other documents or committing some other tax crime or an ele – a further election fraud crime. And so the prosecution, I think, did it as well as anybody could do for laypeople, because the jury obviously was a series of laypeople, that this was a serious thing that undermined and interfered with the election in 2016. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. PREET BHARARA: And that's serious and not to be taken lightly. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you know, we're seeing some rhetoric from Republican lawmakers, including Senator Marco Rubio, who said Mr. Trump was ""held hostage, the victim of a sham political show trial, like the ones the communists used in Cuba and the Soviet Union, railing against the ruling class."" In terms of our judicial system in this country, how should someone understand a characterization like that? PREET BHARARA: Well, I think, you know, it's silly. It's completely silly. The trial and all aspects of the trial were done openly and in public. The jury selection process, someone needs to be reminded, was participated in by the Trump legal team as well. They had all the peremptory challenges that they're accorded by law. The judge, although there's some, you know, accusations made about his impartiality or lack thereof, his rulings are there to see, as other people have pointed out. He ruled in favor of the Trump team sometimes. He ruled against the Trump team sometimes. He was pretty fair and even-handed. A jury of 12 people… MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. PREET BHARARA: … who were selected and approved by both sides brought – brought in the verdict. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. PREET BHARARA: So I don't know what – what is sham about it. The rules of evidence were – were followed and complied with. So, I – I don't really know what's happening here… MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. PREET BHARARA: … other than pure partisan politics. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, yesterday, President Biden was spending time with his son Hunter. And, tomorrow, in another unusual situation our country is in, the Biden Justice Department will begin a trial in Delaware against the president's son, where Hunter faces three felony gun possession charges, maximum 25 years prison. How much hot water is he in here? PREET BHARARA: He's in substantial hot water, because he's been charged federally, just like Donald Trump is in a lot of hot water being charged in a state court. But I think an important thing to consider here, by the way, in the wake of your question about the – the accusations of this vast conspiracy by both state prosecutors and the – and the federal Justice Department that is acting in a witch-hunt fashion, in a partisan fashion to bring down the Republican Party, here, you have the son of the sitting president of the United States of America going to trial at the hands of his own Justice Department. In a million years, can anyone listening to this broadcast understand and expect that if – if Donald Trump was elected again, and a Biden holdover U.S. attorney were to indict Donald Trump Jr., that… MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. PREET BHARARA: … Donald Trump wouldn't do something about it, in the way that Joe Biden has stayed out of it? I don't think so. So that's an important thing to remember. And, also, the other thing that's happening this week… MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. PREET BHARARA: … is a continuation of the trial against Democratic senior and important Senator Bob Menendez… MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. PREET BHARARA: … by the same Justice Department that these politicians are accusing of being partisan. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Preet Bharara, thank you for your insight and analysis. We're going to have to leave it there. And Face the Nation will be back in a minute. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum. Based on our CBS News reporting, he is under serious consideration by the former president to become his running mate in this campaign. Good morning to you, Governor. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM (R-North Dakota): Good morning, Margaret. Good to be with you. MARGARET BRENNAN: It's good to have you back on Face the Nation. You just heard our polling there; 57 percent Americans think the jury reached the right verdict; 56 percent think Trump got a fair trial. A majority of Americans are unconvinced by this claim that it's all a sham. Why do you think it is? GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: Well, I think part of it, of course, polling is a point in time. And I had a chance to briefly look at some of your poll numbers this morning. And I also saw there that almost two-thirds of the respondents said they weren't paying close attention. And I understand that they're not paying close attention to the trial, because most Americans out there, you know, they've got – working Americans don't have time to watch, you know, TV all day, read every report, because they're facing all the things, you know, putting food on the table, gas in the car… MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: … all the challenges that they're facing. And I think that, as this moment in time passes, when we have the election coming this fall, people are going to make a decision about, were they better – are they better off today than they were four years ago? MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: And this is an unusual thing, that this is not – President Trump's not a candidate that's unknown or never run before. They had an opportunity to live their life under four years of him. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: And they had a chance to, you know, prosper. And they had a chance to understand what the world was like, no wars. And now that – it's a very different situation. So, I – I think, while this is – it's interesting, and it's captivating right now to a lot of people… MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: … the election is not going to turn on this trial. MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S. isn't involved in a war right now either. But in… GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: Well, we're involved in two proxy wars. MARGARET BRENNAN: We were then as well. But, on – on your point, Donald Trump spends a lot of time talking about these trials. It – it's not just journalists. And it's historic. But he talks quite a lot about it. And, in fact, he held an extensive news conference Friday with a litany of grievances against the judge, who will still have to decide on his sentencing. Personal judgment-wise, do you think that was a smart thing to do? GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: Well, I have a lot of empathy for what he must feel like, and – because as a businessperson, I – and I – someone who spent - - and I spent 30 years in tech, but a lot of that was in software that dealt with business processes. I mean, I have – I have never seen anything like this, where you can, you know, magically take, you know, a transaction that gets spread out over 11 – 11 paychecks, or paychecks – 12 vouchers, you know, 11 invoices, and, suddenly, each of those around one decision, they magically become, instead of misdemeanors, they become a felony. And if they're misdemeanor… MARGARET BRENNAN: Because of the election fraud, as – as you just heard. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: Well, but if – well, but if – if – I don't know that anybody in America – if we're asking about the voter, I don't know if anybody American can explain how a – business transaction filing errors from seven years ago become federal election law, when federal election law is not a state. This was brought in a county court. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: Federal election is federal. And I don't know the alchemy of transforming these misdemeanors, which had a two-year statute of limitations – what I'm saying, from a business perspective, CEOs around America… MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: … if you've had hundreds of millions of business filings in America in the last seven years, why aren't our courts clogged with other CEOs that were dragged in front of… MARGARET BRENNAN: If they were running for president and changing those business records to obscure donations to their own campaign – you know what I'm saying. This isn't just filing error. But… GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: Well, I – I hear what you're saying. But most Americans cannot explain it. Many – many of the legal experts… MARGARET BRENNAN: It's complicated, sure. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: Many of the legal experts that stood on the curb outside the courthouse for six years can't – for six weeks can't explain it. So Americans are going to come back to the issues that affect them, because this trial outcome doesn't affect them. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: Their – inflation affects them. MARGARET BRENNAN: It does. And I want to talk about some of those issues more in depth with you in a few minutes. We just put up a graph to – to show you our – our polling. It's two- thirds of those polled said they are watching closely. But in – in terms of, like, the bookkeeping argument, this was about a criminal conspiracy to influence an election and creating paperwork to cover it up. If the quibble is about paperwork violations, the president of the United States, his son, says, under the influence of drugs, he committed a paperwork error. That's now going to federal court because of what he did in purchasing that gun. That was a paperwork violation. Are you also offended by that? Is that also a miscarriage of justice? GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: Well, I think what's sad for America is the whole weaponization of the – the system. And what – we're going to see more of this. I mean, earlier in my life… MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think it's weaponized against Hunter Biden? GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: I think that is – is weaponized against President Trump. But if you're going to talk about equivalency in the courts, then we know that media companies have – have acknowledged that they worked in – in conjunction with the federal government to suppress information about Hunter Biden's laptop during an election year. MARGARET BRENNAN: That is not true whatsoever when it comes to this journalist or the journalists involved with this program. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: Well, then what – why were his – why were his stories about it taken down off of media companies? Why – why – why was it being suppressed during that election? Why – so – why – talk about the Steele dossier. I mean, we could go back. There – there is all kinds of things going on in our country related to election integrity. And I think, whether you're an independent, you're a Democrat, you're a Republican… MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: … we should all care about election integrity. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: And – and we – and if we want – if we want to have equivalency, then it – to make sure that we're – we have a level playing field. MARGARET BRENNAN: We have to finish this conversation on the other side of this commercial break. So let me do that and we'll finish it. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: Sure. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, stay with me, Governor. And stay with us one second. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Tune in on our streaming political show on CBS News 24/7 tomorrow. We will have a lot more from our poll on Trump's guilty verdict. America Decides airs weekdays at 5:00 p.m. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation and Governor Burgum. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We want to continue our conversation now with North Dakota Republican Governor Doug Burgum. Governor, North Dakota has tremendous energy resources. And you reportedly are helping the Trump campaign craft energy policy. That's accurate? GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM (R-ND): Well, I wouldn't say that. I'm just saying that I'm volunteering to support President Trump during this campaign because, as an energy rich state full of natural resources, and I've had the honor of being a governor under President Trump - MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: And also under President Biden. And I see the difference between the two administrations. And I've got a front row seat in understanding that the - the Biden energy policies are, you know, hard on the American consumers. They're empowering adversaries overseas and they're - they're really tough on our allies. MARGARET BRENNAN: There - there is more oil being produced in this country now than any country ever, 13 million barrels per day last year. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: Yes, and North Dakota's down and Iran is up under these policies. And the policies are built around the idea that somehow, if you shut down the U.S. energy industry, that - that that's going to be good for the environment. But when we stop production here, because it may be higher than it has been before by a little bit – MARGARET BRENNAN: It has - it is. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: But it should be much higher because we should be displacing energy coming from Venezuela, coming from Iran, coming from Russia. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let me ask you about that. Let me - let me ask you about that. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: The people that are funding the was that we're fighting are doing that on their oil sales. MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you that. Is - according to ""The Washington Post"" and their reporting, Donald Trump met with oil executives and said, if they raise a billion dollars to return him to the White House, he'll reduce regulation if elected, start auctioning off leases for drilling in - GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: I was at that meeting. I was at that meeting. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: That did not happen. That is not what happened at that meeting. And that's been reported over and over and over again. MARGARET BRENNAN: Did he ask for a billion dollars in donations? GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: He didn't ask for a billion dollars in donations, and there was no quid pro quo. I mean, think what he did last time for the energy - this guy cut regulation for everybody, whether they donated to him or not. He helped get gas prices down for all Americans, Republicans, independents and Democrats, whether they donated to him or not. It drives me crazy when - MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the economy was also shut down due to Covid, which lowered prices too. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: It drives me - when people went on - people went on hearsay that weren't at the meeting on hearsay report it like it's a fact, when it's not a fact. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I'm asking you to make sure. ""The Washington Post"" also reported that Trump suggested to those oil executives he would ease scrutiny of industry mergers and acquisitions if he wins. Do you think that the industry needs to consolidate and big oil needs to get bigger? GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: I think that the free enterprise needs to operate at ways that are efficiently to be able to compete on a global - on a global level. And what's going on in the industry – MARGARET BRENNAN: So, he would do that? GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: I'm not saying he would do that. But I tell you what - what Joe Biden's administration is doing right now, two companies want to merge, and then they come in and then they, what, they confiscate all the executives' phone numbers ahead of time, make accusations about collusions. This has never happened to another industry. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, what was promised in that meeting since you said you were there? GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: He - he didn't make promises. He listened. He went around the room for two hours asking each of the people to tell me, what are your challenges, what are you facing, what are the - what are the things - he was there learning the whole night about the challenges that we're facing. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, is he targeting the industry to finance his re- election bid? GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: I think anybody he's met with - he'll be meeting with people in Silicon Valley. He's meeting people in - across every industry. He's not targeting anybody, he's doing what candidates do, which is, you go and listen to an industry. And this industry in particular, which is the fundamental to the entire economy. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: It's not just one industry. It feeds the inflation, which is affecting every American. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: To say, what can we do to produce cleaner energy, more efficiently? President Trump talks all the time about getting oil prices down. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: Oil executives are not thrilled when he says, I'm going to get oil prices down. You know, they - they make more money when oil prices are up. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, OK. So, climate and - and environmental policy are important to young voters in particular. Are you at all concerned that you will alienate them by aligning so closely with the energy industry? GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: Well, I'm not concerned about it at all because I know in North Dakota we're - we - we are producing energy cleaner, safer and smarter than any place else in the world here in the United States - MARGARET BRENNAN: So you do want to keep some of the environmental restrictions then? GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: The environmental restrictions are hurting this country, they're not helping it. If the innovation - MARGARET BRENNAN: (INAUDIBLE). GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: People that think that you're going to solve the environmental issues with regulations, the way we solve that is with innovation. And the way we solve it with innovation is, we innovate to have zero carbon liquid fuels or low carbon liquid fuels. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: The Biden administration is on team China. They want to have every car be an EV, and then we've got to get - China controls 85 percent of the rare earth minerals. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, but they just tariff them. Would talk to you for an hour about rare earth minerals, sir. We'll have to have you come back another time to talk about that global competition. But we're going to have to leave it there and turn to one of the crises right now out of the Middle East with the Israel-Hamas conflict. Joining us is Scott Anderson. He is the director of the U.N.'s refugee efforts in Gaza. UNRWA is the largest relief agency for Palestinian refugees. And he joins us right now from Aman, Jordan. Scott, I know you were in the U.S. Army. You served two tours in Afghanistan. From what you've seen in Gaza, how does it compare? I'm sorry, I cannot hear Scott right now. SCOTT ANDERSON (Director, UNRWA Affairs Gaza): Sorry. MARGARET BRENNAN: There you go. SCOTT ANDERSON: I was going to say, Gaza is much worse, Margaret, than Afghanistan was. I mean everywhere you go, the scale of destruction just really defies description. And it looks like something out of an apocalyptic movie. Most places you're looking at 90 to 100 percent destruction with the infrastructure suffering much worse. So, I never saw anything quite like that in Afghanistan that we're seeing now in Gaza. MARGARET BRENNAN: The USAID chief, Sam Power - Samantha Power, said, conditions are worse now in Gaza than ever before. She said that was due to the Israeli military operations and closed crossings. What exactly is the humanitarian situation right now? SCOTT ANDERSON: So, what you have is 2.2 million people that have all been displaced at least once. Most have been displaced multiple times. In Rafah, ahead of the operation, we had over a million people again displaced, Khan Yunis to Karabela (ph). And what they're lacking is really just the basic necessities that we all kind of expect. They need food. They need access to water. They need access to showers, access to toilets, access to medical care. And, unfortunately, because of a variety of factors, we're unable to import everything that's needed and to make sure that everybody has the basic necessities that they need to get through every day. MARGARET BRENNAN: Nineteen different aid organizations released a letter this week saying Palestinians are surviving on less than 3 percent of their daily water needs. Hepatitis is spreading. Medical evacuations have been halted. Virtually every hospital has been issued evacuation orders. The Pentagon said it has suspended air drops of food because of the Israeli military action. And, as we know, the pier is not really operating. Who exactly is impeding the delivery? SCOTT ANDERSON: I think it's a variety of things, not just one person you can point to. All of the - the bulk of our aid comes in through Karam Shalam (ph). It all comes through Egypt. Starts at Port Saeed (ph), goes through the Siani Calarish (ph) and eventually makes its way to Karam Shalam, where it's brought in by us to the Palestinian side and then onward for the last mile distribution within Gaza. There's a lot of steps that have to go perfectly right for all that to work. And, unfortunately, not everything has gone right. For a time Egypt was not sending trucks where we had 80,000 metric tons of aid in a country we couldn't access. And - and we're - we've been perpetually playing catch- up on the aid situation since October. Not everybody has a tent that needs one. So you have people sleeping outside still as we're eight months after the start of the conflict. And you - you highlighted correctly our number one concern at this point, which is access to clean drinking water. You know, without that, in addition to hepatitis, you have things like cholera and other diseases that can become very prevalent and we could see an outbreak happen very soon. And it's something that concerns us. And, additionally, it's getting hot. You know, it's summer. It's essentially you're in the desert. And if people don't have access to clean drinking water, that's a problem for dehydration, as well as for disease. MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you are with the U.N. so you can't talk about politics and policy, but President Biden did make this address Friday talking about a proposal for a cease-fire and hostage deal. He said it would come with 600 aid trucks per day to enter Gaza with supplies, with shelter, and the like. Who's going to be doing all of that distribution? SCOTT ANDERSON: I mean that would be the entire international humanitarian community because of the scale. I mean currently, UNRWA feeds a little over half the population. We're feeding about 1.3 or 1.4 million people every day. But it would be us, along with the rest of the U.N. and all our partners. And I would say, we very much welcome a cease-fire. It's time for the hostages to go home to their families. Time for more aid to start coming in and then hopefully we can start rebuilding Gaza. MARGARET BRENNAN: Scott Anderson, thank you for telling us what you are seeing and experiencing on the ground. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by the former commander of U.S. forces in the Middle East, retired General Frank McKenzie. His new book, ""The Melting Point,"" is available this Tuesday. Good to see you, sir. GENERAL FRANK MCKENZIE (Ret., Former Commander of U.S. Central Command and Author, ""The Melting Point""): Good to be here, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, on Friday, President Biden said that Hamas is no longer capable of carrying out another October 7th. When you were last with us in February, you said Israel's success has been very limited. Do you think they can declare success now? GENERAL FRANK MCKENZIE: I think they're a lot closer than they were a few months ago. I still think Hamas political and military leadership exists largely whole. A lot of their combat formations have been destroyed. But I think Hamas has been significantly atritted (ph). MARGARET BRENNAN: You also have raised a few times in the past few months concerns about America's continued presence in the Middle East, which you say is crucial here. Right now we are seeing so many different flash points. One of them in the Red Sea, where our CBS' David Martin reported the U.S. used a 5,000 pound bunker buster bomb in Yemen just this past week. The Houthis are attacking shipping. We have concerns about the troop safety in Syria and in Iraq. Does it need to continue? GENERAL FRANK MCKENZIE: Well, I think we remain the critical nation in the Middle East. I think everybody looks at us to be the honest broker. If we take the situation with the Houthis as simply one example, I would argue that we've been too passive. We've allowed the Houthis really to dominate global maritime communications by closing down effectively the Suez Canal. And that is something that's not only bad for the United States, but for many other nations around the world. It has nothing to do actually with Israel or the conflict in Gaza. Rather, it's a larger principle for the United States. But we've essentially been catching and not pitching in this conflict despite deploying multibillion-dollar warships into the Red Sea. The sign that we're dropping larger bombs may be a good thing, but we need to go after the source of the attacks. And the source of the attacks is Houthi leadership and command and control facilities in Yemen. And I would argue that the threat of escalation is very small if we conduct these attacks. MARGARET BRENNAN: When you say we, you think the Biden administration? GENERAL FRANK MCKENZIE: I think the United States and our allies. MARGARET BRENNAN: You largely try to avoid politics and directly addressing the presidents you served under in the book that you wrote here, but you have had such a key role in some of these very significant national security decisions, killing the ISIS commander, Baghdadi, taking Qassem Soleimani off the battlefield, executing the withdrawal from Afghanistan. And you spread around some blame to past U.S. presidents. But you do point to the Doha agreement, the withdraw negotiated by the Trump administration, as one of the worst negotiating mistakes ever made by the U.S. Why? GENERAL FRANK MCKENZIE: I think it was. And it was – and also, by the way, we implemented the agreement. Had we actually stuck to the strict terms of the agreement, we might have been able to make something of it. But, in fact, we treated the Doha agreement as a schedule for us to depart Afghanistan. And that policy objective remained across two presidents, President Trump and President Biden. When, in fact, there are procedures in the Doha agreement, if we had respected them, that would require the Taliban to do certain things in return. We did not require that. And, effectively, I would argue, that the Doha agreement was the operational mechanism that killed Afghanistan, that destroyed the government of Afghanistan, because they saw we were eager to leave, regardless of cost, and that was a very important and deflating thing, I think, for the government of Afghanistan. MARGARET BRENNAN: As you point out, that was across two presidents. GENERAL FRANK MCKENZIE: Absolutely. MARGARET BRENNAN: Biden and Trump? GENERAL FRANK MCKENZIE: Margaret, I would argue that President Trump and President Biden, was (INAUDIBLE) as any two presidents in our history, but they both shared a policy objective of leaving Afghanistan, regardless really of the consequences. MARGARET BRENNAN: You wrote that you drafted resignation letters a few times, but the only time you actually came close was after that withdraw from Afghanistan and a drone strike August 29th that was intended to kill ISIS but killed civilians. If you had such strong objections, why was that the moment where you almost resigned and not others? GENERAL FRANK MCKENZIE: So, I feel it's very important that generals don't resign over policy differences. That's not good for the republic. It's not the way that our military system should work. And, historically, it's not the way it has worked back to the Korean War, back to the Second World War. Many generals - many senior generals disagreed with presidential decisions, but they did not resign. So, I did not feel it was appropriate to resign. In my particular case, if there had been discussions of charging my subordinates, that I felt it was necessary for me to actually accept part of that blame. Now, we did not do that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. You stayed on. You, in the book, talk quite a lot about conversations you had around how to implement the withdraw from Afghanistan and the planning for it, particularly with the Trump administration. At one point you say the chief of staff to President Trump, Mark Meadows, advised not to present certain options out of concern he'd choose them, like going to zero in Afghanistan. You wrote, Trump made the decision to kill Qassem Soleimani, but his national security advisors were telling him there won't be any consequences for it, which is not what U.S. intelligence said and that is not what U.S. CENTCOM thought. Why is it important for the public to know that the people around the commanders in chief were either not sharing full picture with him or changing what he was allowed to see? GENERAL FRANK MCKENZIE: Well, every president, whether it - the last - either the last two have advisors that give them all kinds of different opinions. The military input that comes in is one part of that. And that was my - and I was relentlessly focused on that. Every president also has to make political calculations, not just these two presidents, but presidents as far back as President Roosevelt in the Second World War had to balance internal U.S. political objectives with what was going on around the world. So, that's not new or unusual in these times. I think in the case of Qassem Soleimani, I think President Trump made the right decision. I do not believe ultimately we made the right decision in Afghanistan. And I've been pretty clear about that in open - in open testimony. And that goes across two presidents. MARGARET BRENNAN: But it is cherry-picking, right, information to present to the commander in chief when he has to make a call. And you write about the internessing (ph) bickering you say and finger-pointing that followed Trump political appointees at the Pentagon. You wrote about the choice of drawing down the 2,500 troops. You say you don't even know where that number came from. It was kind of arbitrary. And there was an incident in which a mysterious signed letter appeared saying withdraw from Afghanistan. And you hunted that down and it was ultimately discarded. How does something like that happen with such high consequence, and do you fear that it could happen again if there is a second Trump administration? GENERAL FRANK MCKENZIE: Well, Margaret, I think the period of time from the presidential election of 2021, until the inauguration of 2022, was a particularly dangerous time inside the Pentagon. And I believe there that that's where the U.S. military has a role to play. It's a non-political role. It's a role where we answer the orders that we're given. And, at the same time, you have political appointees inside the Pentagon, they're appointed by the president and members of his party, and they have their own objectives there. And we respond to orders from the chain of command. It's very important to know who can actually give orders and who can't give orders. A lot of people that walk around the Pentagon are not in a position to give orders. The orders flow from the president to the secretary to the combatant commanders. Everyone else has an opinion, and those opinions may actually impact the decisions that are made, but they're not in the chain of command. MARGARET BRENNAN: General, it is a fascinating read. Thank you for coming on to talk about the book. GENERAL FRANK MCKENZIE: Thanks, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now with - by Matt Pottinger, who served as deputy national security adviser in the Trump administration. He is the author of the new book ""The Boiling Moat: Urgent Steps to Defend Taiwan,"" available in July. Matt, you say the clock's ticking. Beijing has been engaged in the most comprehensive peacetime military buildup of any nation since World War II."" Are you predicting that conflict will happen either on President Biden or President Trump, if he's re-elected, on their watch? MATT POTTINGER (Former Deputy National Security Adviser and Author, ""The Boiling Moat: Urgent Steps to Defend Taiwan"": Well, what is clear is that the dictator in Beijing, Xi Jinping, intends to try to take Taiwan, to annex it, by force if necessary. We also know that this would be catastrophic for American prosperity and security. But my co-authors and I are actually quite optimistic that this is a war that can be deterred, but it means that we've got to take some steps urgently. These are workable steps. It doesn't require massive new investment. We've got the technologies we need. But Taiwan, Japan and the United States in particular, need to take the steps that we think we've laid out in the book. MARGARET BRENNAN: This week the defense secretary is in Asia. And he actually met with his Chinese defense minister counterpart. You can see it there. This is like the first meeting since 2022. Last guy disappeared. MATT POTTINGER: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: But Austin said, a fight with China is neither imminent or unavoidable. When we hear the kind of rhetoric out of Washington right now, it sounds like we are headed towards conflict. What are the things you're saying need to be done to avoid it? MATT POTTINGER: Yes. Well, for starters, we need to invest more in munitions making. OK, so one of the things that the Chinese government is looking at is, would we be able to stay in a fight more than just the first, you know, the initial battle that would be involved in taking Taiwan? If they don't think we have the industrial base - and right now we haven't optimized our industrial base to do that - we're - MARGARET BRENNAN: Even with the national security supplemental investment in (INAUDIBLE)? MATT POTTINGER: Absolutely. Look, we - we - amazingly, I don't think many Americans realize, our defense spending right now is less than half of what it was in the 1980s during the Cold War. And that was during the Reagan administration. We didn't have to go to war, partly because we put the money into that. Our military, in terms of manpower, is smaller today than it was on the eve of World War II. So, we have to put more money into it. It's - it's - but we also have to do things to optimize our defense spending so that it's not guaranteed profits, no matter how inefficient the manufacturers are. There are things that we can do to super charge our military manufacturing to take advantage of our innovative base. MARGARET BRENNAN: It's interesting to hear you and before you the general talk about the scale of the problem set facing the president of the United States and the next commander in chief. So, that's why I think it's important to have this conversation this week. You did resign from the Trump administration after the violent attack on the Capitol on January the 6th. You then testified to Congress that you feared America's national security was in harm that day. That it gave ammunition to feed a narrative that our system of government doesn't work, the U.S. is in decline. If you continue to contest an election, you're not just contesting an election, you're actually challenging the Constitution itself. Do you fear that erosion is taking place right now with what we are hearing on the campaign trail? MATT POTTINGER: Well, look, I think the perception of erosion is. I actually think the United States is incredibly strong. We have all of these advantages. The century can be ours if we don't lose our nerve. I think that - look, Election Day will be a referendum. It's the best kind of referendum. It's where the American people get to decide who the next president's going to be. I hope that the outcome is decisive so that we don't end up with either side challenging the results. But if they do, just like with the last election, the courts will determine it. We have a system in place that allows us to adjudicate the outcomes of our elections. MARGARET BRENNAN: But now you even have like the ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee coming out and repeating things that undercut our judicial system. MATT POTTINGER: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Comparing the United States to the Soviet Union? MATT POTTINGER: Yes. Well, look, there - there's no way that - MARGARET BRENNAN: What does Beijing think of that? Because it - MATT POTTINGER: Yes, look - look - well, Beijing, it's kind of an interesting moment because Beijing really relishes propaganda that is designed to discredit the United States or to cause us to doubt our - our system of government. But at the same time, you have a jury that is just convicted a president of the United States. You've also got the son of a sitting president, who's - who's now under indictment, just like you heard from Preet Bharara earlier. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. MATT POTTINGER: Beijing's propaganda can only go so far. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. MATT POTTINGER: At the end of the day, Americans, thank God, we live in a system where the American people are going to decide who their president is. They're doing - they - they have - MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. MATT POTTINGER: All the information available to them. MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will try to bring - bring it to them here. Thank you very much, Matt. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. I'm Margaret Brennan. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) ",CBSnews,US
Pilot rescued from burning helicopter that crashed in New Hampshire,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pilot-rescued-burning-helicopter-crash-new-hampshire/,A pilot suffered non life-threatening injuries after being pulled from a burning helicopter that crashed in New Hampshire.,"People who heard a helicopter crash rushed to the site to help remove the pilot from the burning aircraft in a wooded area in central New Hampshire, police said Sunday. The pilot was the helicopter's only occupant when it crashed into a residential property in Merrimack County, the New Hampshire State Police said in a news release. He was ""conscious, breathing and alert"" when authorities from various agencies arrived and transported him to Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center with ""serious but non life-threatening injuries,"" police said.  The pilot was not identified The Hughes TH-55 helicopter went down Saturday afternoon about 30 miles northwest of the state capital, Concord, and caused a fire that was spreading to the woods before the arrival of firefighters, police said. An initial probe into the incident suggested that the pilot lost control of the helicopter near a landing site and subsequently crashed into the wood line of the property. A National Transportation Safety Board spokesperson said the helicopter will be moved to an offsite facility for further examination as part of its investigation. The NTSB is leading the investigation along with the Federal Aviation Administration. New Hampshire State Police have asked anyone who witnessed the crash to contact the Danbury Police Department. The two-seater TH-55 Osage was originally used by the military as a training helicopter, taking flight for the first time in 1956, but many of them have since found their way into civilian use.

Rupert Murdoch marries for 5th time in ceremony at California vineyard,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rupert-murdoch-marries-5th-time-elena-zhukova/,"Media magnate Rupert Murdoch, who is 93, married Elena Zhukova on Saturday.","Rupert Murdoch, 93, has married for the fifth time, his corporation, News Corp, confirmed Sunday. Murdoch, the media mogul who recently stepped down as chairman of Fox News and News Corp, married Elena Zhukova, a 67-year-old Russian-born retired molecular biologist, on Saturday in a ceremony at his vineyard estate in Bel Air, California. Photographs of the newly married couple were released by News Corp. The couple announced their engagement in March. Zhukova studied at the University of California, Los Angeles, according to a New York Times report in March. In her career as a molecular biologist, she focused on diabetes. Zhukova is also the ex-wife of Alexander Zhukov, a billionaire energy investor and Russian politician. Their daughter, Dasha, was previously married to Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, who used to own the Premier League soccer club Chelsea. Abramovich was an early target of Western sanctions after the Kremlin first invaded Ukraine in 2022. After Murdoch stepped down as leader of both Fox News' parent company and his News Corp media holdings, his son, Lachlan, took his place in a media empire that spans continents and helped to shape modern American politics. Murdoch, whose net worth is pegged at $9.77 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, has been married four times before. Most recently, he was engaged to retired dental hygienist Ann Lesley Smith, whom he never married. He was previously married to model Jerry Hall, whom he divorced in the summer of 2022. His first three wives include Patricia Booker, Anna Murdoch Mann, and Wendi Murdoch. In 1952, Murdoch inherited a newspaper in his native Australia from his father. Over decades, he built a news and entertainment enterprise that became prominent in the United States and Britain, including ownership of such notable newspapers as The Times of London and The Wall Street Journal. Fox News Channel, the 24-hour network founded in 1996, has profoundly influenced television, becoming a popular news source among many conservative U.S. audiences and politicians. ",CBSnews,US
Romance Writers of America falls into bankruptcy amid allegations of racism,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/romance-writers-america-bankruptcy-racism-diversity/,Authors complained for years that the organization was predominantly White — causing membership to plummet.,"The Romance Writers of America filed for bankruptcy protection this week following several years of infighting and allegations of racism that fractured the organization, causing many of its members to flee. The Texas-based trade association, which bills itself as the voice of romance writers, has lost roughly 80% of its members over the past five years because of the turmoil. Now down to just 2,000 members, it can't cover the costs it committed to paying for its writers conferences in Texas and Pennsylvania, the group said in bankruptcy court documents filed on Wednesday in Houston. Mary Ann Jock, the group's president and an author of seven published romance novels, said in a court filing that the troubles stemmed ""predominantly due to disputes concerning diversity, equity and inclusion"" issues between previous board members and others in the romance writing community. The organization, founded in 1980 to represent and promote writers in fiction's top-selling genre, said it owes nearly $3 million to hotels where it planned to host the annual meetings. In the court filings, Jock noted how the organization held its 2024 conference in Austin, Texas, and was working to pay off the contract owed to the local Marriott facility where the event was held. At the same time, the Marriott hotel in Philadelphia, where the organization was planning its 2025 conference, demanded a full payment of $1 million, Jock said. The association was pushed into bankruptcy ""in light of the Philadelphia Marriott's demand for immediate payment and without a consensual resolution with the Marriott Conference Centers,"" Jock said. In court documents, the association listed between $100,000 and $500,000 in assets with between $1 million and $10 million in liabilities. Relationships within the group started to fray in 2019, over the way it treated one of its authors, a Chinese American writer who it said violated the group's code with negative online comments about other writers and their work. The association reversed its decision, but the uproar led to the resignation of its president and several board members. The organization at the time had about 10,000 members, Following allegations that it lacked diversity and was predominantly White, the organization called off its annual awards in 2020. Several publishers, including Harlequin, Avon Books and Berkeley Romance, then dropped out from the annual conference. The association later said it would present a new award in honor of Vivian Stephens, a pioneering black romance novelist and publisher. The next year, the association faced more anger and eventually withdrew an award for a novel widely criticized for its sympathetic portrait of a cavalry officer who participated in the slaughter of Lakota Indians at the Battle of Wounded Knee. — The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Costco vows not to hike the price of its $1.50 hot dog combo,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/costco-hot-dog-combo-price/,"Costco hasn't raised the cost of its popular hot dog and soda combo in nearly 40 years, and it's not about to now, a senior exec says.","Rest assured, Costco and wiener fans — despite inflation having driven up the cost of groceries to their highest level in years, the budget retailer has no plans to raise the price of its fabled $1.50 hot dog combo special. The wholesale club's new chief financial officer, Gary Millerchip, underlined that point during a call with Wall Street analysts this week to discuss its third-quarter results. ""To clear up some recent media speculation, I also want to confirm the $1.50 hot dog price is safe,"" Millerchip said, referring to Costco's hot dog and soda deal. Although that might seem like a minor aside for a global retail chain valued at $354 billion, Costco's low-cost dog has become an emblem of the company's commitment to delivering value. In short, it's great marketing. Costco hasn't hiked the price of its hot dog since 1985. Costco has even cracked down who uses its food court to ensure that only warehouse members can get discounted dogs. A basic Costco membership costs $60 annually, while the executive membership, which has perks like a 2% cash-back reward, runs $120 per year. Costco has interest in emphasizing its affordable prices as inflation-weary consumers pull back on everything from fast food to takeout coffee. Target, Walmart, Walgreens and other retailers have also recently dropped their prices on a range of goods. Of course, the Costco dog isn't the only product out there whose price seems like it's from yesteryear. Other popular items whose inflation-adjusted prices have remained relatively low, or even dropped, over the years include coffee, televisions and plane tickets.

Millions of Americans are losing access to low-cost internet service,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fcc-affordable-connectivity-program-internet-costs/,FCC calls on Congress for funding to restart program that helped low-income households get high-speed internet service.,"The nation's largest broadband affordability program is coming to an end due to a lack of congressional funding. The Federal Communications Commission is reluctantly marking the end, as of Saturday, of a pandemic-era program that helped several million low-income Americans get and stay online. Created in December 2020, what became the Affordable Connectivity Program, or ACP, eventually enrolled more than 23 million subscribers — or one in six U.S. households — across rural, suburban and urban America. That demand illustrates that ""too many working families have been trapped on the wrong side of the digital divide because they struggle to pay for the service,"" Jessica Rosenworcel, chairwoman of the FCC, wrote in a Friday statement. ""Additional funding from Congress remains the only near-term solution to keep this vital program up and running,"" the chairwoman said in a letter appealing for help from lawmakers. Previous federal efforts to close the digital divide long focused on making high-speed internet available in all areas, without much thought given to whether people could afford it, Rosenworcel noted. Yet more than one million households enrolled in the first week after the precursor to the ACP launched in May 2021. ""Each of the 23 million-plus ACP subscribers that no longer receives an ACP benefit represents an individual or family in need of just a little bit of help to have the connectivity we all need to participate in modern life,"" stated Rosenworcel. ""And 68% of these households had inconsistent connectivity or zero connectivity before the ACP."" Many ACP recipients are seniors on fixed incomes, and the loss of the benefit means hard choices between online access or going without other necessities such as food or gas, the FCC head said. ""We also heard from a 47-year-old in Alabama who's going back to school to become a psychologist and could now use a laptop instead of her phone to stay on top of online classwork."" The program officially ends on June 1, 2024, with the FCC already imposing an enrollment freeze in February to smooth its administration of the ACP's end. Approximately 3.4 million rural households and more than 300,000 households in tribal areas are impacted, as well as more than four million households with an active duty for former military member, according to the agency. While not a replacement for the ACP, there is another FCC program called Lifeline that provides a $9.25 monthly benefit on broadband service for eligible households, the FCC said.

"Google admits its AI Overviews can generate ""some odd, inaccurate"" results",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/google-ai-overview/,Google said it's rolling back its AI-generated search results feature after two weeks. Here's why.,"Google on Thursday admitted that its AI Overviews tool, which uses artificial intelligence to respond to search queries, needs improvement. While the internet search giant said it tested the new feature extensively before launching it two weeks ago, Google acknowledged that the technology produces ""some odd and erroneous overviews."" Examples include suggesting using glue to get cheese to stick to pizza or drinking urine to pass kidney stones quickly. While many of the examples were minor, others search results were potentially dangerous. Asked by the Associated Press last week which wild mushrooms were edible, Google provided a lengthy AI-generated summary that was mostly technically correct. But ""a lot of information is missing that could have the potential to be sickening or even fatal,"" said Mary Catherine Aime, a professor of mycology and botany at Purdue University who reviewed Google's response to the AP's query. For example, information about mushrooms known as puffballs was ""more or less correct,"" she said, but Google's overview emphasized looking for those with solid white flesh - which many potentially deadly puffball mimics also have. In another widely shared example, an AI researcher asked Google how many Muslims have been president of the U.S., and it responded confidently with a long-debunked conspiracy theory: ""The United States has had one Muslim president, Barack Hussein Obama."" The rollback is the latest instance of a tech company prematurely rushing out an AI product to position itself as a leader in the closely watched space. Because Google's AI Overviews sometimes generated unhelpful responses to queries, the company is scaling it back while continuing to make improvements, Google's head of search, Liz Reid, said in a company blog post Thursday. ""[S]ome odd, inaccurate or unhelpful AI Overviews certainly did show up. And while these were generally for queries that people don't commonly do, it highlighted some specific areas that we needed to improve,"" Reid said. Nonsensical questions such as, ""How many rocks should I eat?"" generated questionable content from AI Overviews, Reid said, because of the lack of useful, related advice on the internet. She added that the AI Overviews feature is also prone to taking sarcastic content from discussion forums at face value, and potentially misinterpreting webpage language to present inaccurate information in response to Google searches. ""In a small number of cases, we have seen AI Overviews misinterpret language on webpages and present inaccurate information. We worked quickly to address these issues, either through improvements to our algorithms or through established processes to remove responses that don't comply with our policies,"" Reid wrote. For now, the company is scaling back on AI-generated overviews by adding ""triggering restrictions for queries where AI Overviews were not proving to be as helpful."" Google also says it tries not to show AI Overviews for hard news topics ""where freshness and factuality are important."" The company said it has also made updates ""to limit the use of user-generated content in responses that could offer misleading advice."" —The Associated Press contributed to this report.

MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington. And this week on Face the Nation: With former President Trump now officially a convicted felon, how will that impact campaign 2024? Donald Trump was among the faithful when he dropped in on the Saturday night Ultimate Fighting Championship in New Jersey last night. (Begin VT) ANNOUNCER: Boy, the round of applause he's getting right now is pretty staggering. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: But what do voters think of the Trump conviction outside the UFC? We have got early reaction from across America, and we will tell you what's ahead on the legal front. (Begin VT) DONALD TRUMP (Former President of the United States (R) and Current U.S. Presidential Candidate): So we're going to be appealing this scam. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Plus, how's the outcome of the case playing with the parties? For Democrats, it's a defense of the judicial system. (Begin VT) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: And it's reckless, it's dangerous, and it's irresponsible for anyone to say this was rigged just because they don't like the verdict. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: And the Republican refrain? Attack it. (Begin VT) FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The Republican Party has really – they have stuck. They stick together in this. They see what's – it's weaponization of the Justice Department, of the FBI. And, you know, that's all coming out of Washington. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: North Dakota Governor and Trump running mate contender Doug Burgum will be here. And we will talk with former U.S. attorney Preet Bharara. Finally: The U.S. makes a major announcement, in hopes of pushing Israel to end the war with Hamas, as the Gaza humanitarian crisis continues to grow. It's all just ahead on Face the Nation. Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. The seven-week New York criminal trial is over. Former President Donald Trump has been found guilty on all 34 charges against him. And he is now able to campaign freely until July 11, when he will be sentenced. That's exactly four days before he is officially nominated at the party's convention in Milwaukee. As a felon, Trump cannot own a firearm or serve in a jury, but he can vote for himself, as he can run and be elected president. But we are clearly in uncharted territory, and it will be some time before we can fully see the impact of the conviction. Our new CBS News poll finds that 57 percent of Americans think the jury reached the right verdict, with virtually the same share, 56 percent, saying he received a fair trial. As more evidence of the partisan split in America, 96 percent of Democrats said the guilty verdict was the right one. So did 56 percent of independents. But eight in 10 Republicans say the verdict was the wrong one and that the trial was not fair. Finally, half think that Trump is not fit to be president now that he's convicted, with 40 percent saying he is and 8 percent unsure. What you just heard Trump say about the case coming from Washington is not true. Charges in this case were brought by the Manhattan district attorney. It is a state case, which means an appeal would not automatically go to the Supreme Court. For analysis and context, we want to bring in our chief campaign and elections correspondent Robert Costa, who covers Trump and the entire trial for us in New York, and our chief legal correspondent, Jan Crawford, who has been covering the Supreme Court for decades, but, Jan, nothing like this ever before. Jan, can you help us to understand? Trump said he will try to appeal this conviction. What is the next step? JAN CRAWFORD: Well, I mean, as he said, you know, this is a long way from over. But there is, I think, zero chance this is going to be overturned before November. And the road ahead for Trump on appeal doesn't look too good either. As for timing, he's got 30 days to file what's called a notice of appeal. That's procedural. That could then start the process through the New York court state system, which could take over a year. Now, you said, as you pointed out in the intro, his supporters have been kind of throwing around the Supreme Court, he can involve the Supreme Court, this. But you have to go through when you're challenging a criminal conviction the state court system first. Then he would turn to try to get the Supreme Court to take the case by raising constitutional issues. As for the appeal itself that he will try to file, the lawyers throughout the trial, I think, were laying the groundwork for possible issues from start to finish, I mean, starting with the venue in heavily Democratic New York, the indictment, the charges themselves, a pretty novel legal theory, bringing in federal election law to a state case. He's going to talk about the evidence that was allowed or not allowed. He could talk about the jury instructions and certain components of that, even attacking the impartiality of the judge himself. But that is a very tough road to hoe. He's got to show this is clear reversible error. That is very difficult to do on any kind of appeal. And so, I mean, that's why people say, Bob, if you're ever in trouble, spend your money on a good trial lawyer, because, once you get into the appeals process, the odds are not good, and not good for Donald Trump here. MARGARET BRENNAN: Bob, the political impact here, obviously, we're in the early stages. But we know that Lara Trump, who is chair of the RNC, said on another network this morning they had raised $70 million in 48 hours. Is this only helpful? ROBERT COSTA: It's helpful in terms of raising money, but, for former President Trump, there is still a logistical nightmare on the horizon. When I spoke to his lawyer Todd Blanche, the – he didn't rule out the possibility that Trump could be in jail during the Republican National Convention. When sentencing happens on July 11, there's an expectation he could be put on probation. But this was a tense trial. I was there for seven weeks. When you sat inside that court, at times, the judge cleared the courtroom because he was so frustrated with the defense and one of the witnesses that was being called. Trump violated the gag order multiple times. So, Republicans, the top Republicans in this country, are privately telling me they're not ruling out the possibility that Trump could be in prison when he accepts the nomination. There's a real concern that some traditional Republicans, suburban Republicans, might look at someone being called a convicted felon and say, I really can't go there, even as it motivates so many of Trump's core supporters. MARGARET BRENNAN: But, Jan, I mean, from all the research we have done, it seems like legal experts do not believe that there will be jail time. JAN CRAWFORD: No, not in this kind of case, not in this kind of case, first-time offender whose age… MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that just a political talking point? JAN CRAWFORD: I mean, I think it would be pretty shocking to most people who followed the New York court system that he would get jail time for this. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. And that's not just because of Secret Service detail or who he is. JAN CRAWFORD: No, it's – if he's treated like other defendants facing a similar charge, again, also because of his age, he's – he would be a first-time offender. And – and the charge itself is somewhat unusual, bringing in that federal election law. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. JAN CRAWFORD: So, typically, in these kind of cases, you would have other charges, fraud charges, that could then carry jail time. So that makes this case different as well. It's just this one issue. MARGARET BRENNAN: But he does now have a criminal record. And there are three other criminal cases. Just to remind people, at – in the federal level, the special counsel has the two, one, related to national security and mishandling classified information, the other trying to change the outcome of the 2020 election. And then there's the Georgia case as well. When will the Supreme Court make a decision on whether Mr. Trump will face charges and trial ultimately for these federal cases? JAN CRAWFORD: Well, of course, you know, Trump has said he's absolutely immune from prosecution. He lost that argument in every court that has first considered it. I think he's going to lose that in the Supreme Court that he's absolutely immune. But this court does seem to think, like, on the civil side, there may be some immunity. And so they're working on that decision now. We expect it by the end of June. They have agreed to expedite this case. This case, if it were on the normal course of business, would come sometime in the fall or winter. So, Jack Smith, the special counsel, asked for a decision sometime this term. He is going to get that. The question now is whether or not he will then have time, if this case has to go back to the lower court and kind of figure out what immunity Trump does have, whether he will have time to have a trial before November. But I think this verdict does lessen the pressure on the Supreme Court and on Jack Smith to get that conviction. There is a conviction now already, and it's not going to be overturned by November. MARGARET BRENNAN: Interesting point. Bob, quickly, our polling also shows 85 percent of Republicans feel loyalty to Trump is either very or somewhat important. How's that impacting the campaign? ROBERT COSTA: People close to former President Trump tell me that he is watching very closely. Who's on television defending him? Who's going out there and really speaking out and saying Trump did not deserve to be found guilty? Who is going to rally to his side at a crisis moment? Inside the Trump campaign, this is seen a lot like the ""Access Hollywood"" moment in October 2016, which was involved, in a sense, with why this trial unfolded. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. ROBERT COSTA: And they're saying, if you're not out for Trump right now, good luck trying to get a spot in this administration should he win. MARGARET BRENNAN: Great analysis and insight from both of you. Thank you. And, Jan, you have got a busy June ahead of you. JAN CRAWFORD: Yes. (LAUGHTER) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will see more of you, I'm sure. (CROSSTALK) (LAUGHTER) MARGARET BRENNAN: And we turn now to former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara, who endorsed Alvin Bragg, the district attorney of Manhattan, in his election. He also used to work with and actually hired Trump's attorney in the case, Todd Blanche. Good morning to you Preet. PREET BHARARA (Former U.S. Attorney, Southern District of New York): Good morning. Just one quick correction. I didn't hire Todd Blanche, but I did promote him twice. And I consider both Alvin Bragg and Todd Blanche to be friends of mine. MARGARET BRENNAN: And to be – he was Mr. Trump's attorney in this trial. So, what does having this criminal record now do for Donald Trump with these other three criminal cases? PREET BHARARA: Oh. Well, so that's an interesting question. You know, there's a lot of speculation about whether or not this criminal conviction will result in a – in a incarcerated period for Donald Trump. That's up in the air. There are arguments in favor. There are arguments against. But whatever happens, the fact of this criminal conviction will be on his record, if it – if it remains, at such a time as the future criminal trials take place. And if he gets a conviction on the federal counts in the future, the fact of this conviction here, if it's still on the books, would result in a potential higher prison sentence in those future cases. So it does have a consequence, because he will now, unlike a week ago, have a criminal record. And criminal records are taken into account in meting out punishment. MARGARET BRENNAN: Important point. You said you had promoted the president's attorney when you used to work together. PREET BHARARA: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Would you promote him based on his performance in court defending Mr. Trump? PREET BHARARA: You know, it's a very easy thing that – that I do and other people do on the panel and criticize people's performances. Sometimes, it's the case that someone could do a better job at trial. Trials are difficult. And there's a lot of scrutiny here. But, sometimes, the facts and the law are what the facts of the law are. And, sometimes, terrific defense lawyers who perform very, very well lose, and, sometimes, not-good defense lawyers win because the government hasn't proven its case. So, I'm not going to take potshots at – at Todd. I – I think he could have been stronger in some of the cross-examinations. And I will leave it at that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, sentencing is July 4 – or – excuse me – July 11, four days before the convention, as we mentioned. What grounds for appeal do you think Mr. Trump has here? PREET BHARARA: So, I think they'll make a number of case – of points. You know, Donald Trump does not want to leave anything on the cutting-room floor. I think some of his arguments are nonfrivolous. I agree with what Jan said that, in the ordinary course, it's very, very difficult to get a criminal conviction overturned, but it happens. It's happened to me. It's happened to any good prosecutor's office that brings aggressive cases. Nobody has a 100 percent record on appeal. That said, it's a very low percentage. I think a number of things, including the fact that the judge didn't change the venue, the fact that the judge didn't recuse himself – I don't think those are strong, but I think those will be made. The fact that Stormy Daniels testified a bit broadly about some of the scurrilous details of their sexual encounter, they will argue were prejudicial and should not have been allowed to come in, although they opened the door to that, arguably. And then there's this sort of technical business that I'm sure causes laypeople's eyes to glaze over. And that is the degree to which the second crime, the thing that made and transformed the misdemeanor into a felony, the basis of that did not have to be decided unanimously by the jury. So, the – the further crime, the felony, was appropriate, based on the jury's decision, if there was – the falsification of the business documents was done to further or to conceal or to commit some other crime, namely, an election crime in New York, and that could have been done three different ways… MARGARET BRENNAN: Well… (CROSSTALK) PREET BHARARA: … the jury instructions, and they don't have to be unanimous on those three different ways. And that's – that's probably an issue for appeal. MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me zero in on that, because that has been something that – that Mr. Trump and his allies have talked about. PREET BHARARA: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of this case, this was about trying to manipulate an election and fraud related to that. His allies say this was just – oh, it was a paperwork thing. Somebody mislabeled this as a legal expense. How would you tell a layperson to understand this? PREET BHARARA: Yes, look, the underlying misdemeanor – and that's why it's a misdemeanor – is falsifying business records. But the reason it becomes a felony, not the most serious felony on the books in New York, but a felony that – any felony is serious – is if that crime, that misdemeanor crime was done to conceal or commit some other crime. And that other crime that the prosecutors alleged and got the convictions on was the unla – promoting someone's election by unlawful means… MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. PREET BHARARA: … either done by the falsification of other documents or committing some other tax crime or an ele – a further election fraud crime. And so the prosecution, I think, did it as well as anybody could do for laypeople, because the jury obviously was a series of laypeople, that this was a serious thing that undermined and interfered with the election in 2016. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. PREET BHARARA: And that's serious and not to be taken lightly. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you know, we're seeing some rhetoric from Republican lawmakers, including Senator Marco Rubio, who said Mr. Trump was ""held hostage, the victim of a sham political show trial, like the ones the communists used in Cuba and the Soviet Union, railing against the ruling class."" In terms of our judicial system in this country, how should someone understand a characterization like that? PREET BHARARA: Well, I think, you know, it's silly. It's completely silly. The trial and all aspects of the trial were done openly and in public. The jury selection process, someone needs to be reminded, was participated in by the Trump legal team as well. They had all the peremptory challenges that they're accorded by law. The judge, although there's some, you know, accusations made about his impartiality or lack thereof, his rulings are there to see, as other people have pointed out. He ruled in favor of the Trump team sometimes. He ruled against the Trump team sometimes. He was pretty fair and even-handed. A jury of 12 people… MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. PREET BHARARA: … who were selected and approved by both sides brought – brought in the verdict. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. PREET BHARARA: So I don't know what – what is sham about it. The rules of evidence were – were followed and complied with. So, I – I don't really know what's happening here… MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. PREET BHARARA: … other than pure partisan politics. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, yesterday, President Biden was spending time with his son Hunter. And, tomorrow, in another unusual situation our country is in, the Biden Justice Department will begin a trial in Delaware against the president's son, where Hunter faces three felony gun possession charges, maximum 25 years prison. How much hot water is he in here? PREET BHARARA: He's in substantial hot water, because he's been charged federally, just like Donald Trump is in a lot of hot water being charged in a state court. But I think an important thing to consider here, by the way, in the wake of your question about the – the accusations of this vast conspiracy by both state prosecutors and the – and the federal Justice Department that is acting in a witch-hunt fashion, in a partisan fashion to bring down the Republican Party, here, you have the son of the sitting president of the United States of America going to trial at the hands of his own Justice Department. In a million years, can anyone listening to this broadcast understand and expect that if – if Donald Trump was elected again, and a Biden holdover U.S. attorney were to indict Donald Trump Jr., that… MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. PREET BHARARA: … Donald Trump wouldn't do something about it, in the way that Joe Biden has stayed out of it? I don't think so. So that's an important thing to remember. And, also, the other thing that's happening this week… MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. PREET BHARARA: … is a continuation of the trial against Democratic senior and important Senator Bob Menendez… MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. PREET BHARARA: … by the same Justice Department that these politicians are accusing of being partisan. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Preet Bharara, thank you for your insight and analysis. We're going to have to leave it there. And Face the Nation will be back in a minute. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum. Based on our CBS News reporting, he is under serious consideration by the former president to become his running mate in this campaign. Good morning to you, Governor.

You just heard our polling there; 57 percent Americans think the jury reached the right verdict; 56 percent think Trump got a fair trial. A majority of Americans are unconvinced by this claim that it's all a sham. Why do you think it is? GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: Well, I think part of it, of course, polling is a point in time. And I had a chance to briefly look at some of your poll numbers this morning. And I also saw there that almost two-thirds of the respondents said they weren't paying close attention. And I understand that they're not paying close attention to the trial, because most Americans out there, you know, they've got – working Americans don't have time to watch, you know, TV all day, read every report, because they're facing all the things, you know, putting food on the table, gas in the car… MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: … all the challenges that they're facing. And I think that, as this moment in time passes, when we have the election coming this fall, people are going to make a decision about, were they better – are they better off today than they were four years ago? MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: And this is an unusual thing, that this is not – President Trump's not a candidate that's unknown or never run before. They had an opportunity to live their life under four years of him. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: And they had a chance to, you know, prosper. And they had a chance to understand what the world was like, no wars. And now that – it's a very different situation. So, I – I think, while this is – it's interesting, and it's captivating right now to a lot of people… MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: … the election is not going to turn on this trial. MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S. isn't involved in a war right now either. But in… GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: Well, we're involved in two proxy wars. MARGARET BRENNAN: We were then as well. But, on – on your point, Donald Trump spends a lot of time talking about these trials. It – it's not just journalists. And it's historic. But he talks quite a lot about it. And, in fact, he held an extensive news conference Friday with a litany of grievances against the judge, who will still have to decide on his sentencing. Personal judgment-wise, do you think that was a smart thing to do? GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: Well, I have a lot of empathy for what he must feel like, and – because as a businessperson, I – and I – someone who spent - - and I spent 30 years in tech, but a lot of that was in software that dealt with business processes. I mean, I have – I have never seen anything like this, where you can, you know, magically take, you know, a transaction that gets spread out over 11 – 11 paychecks, or paychecks – 12 vouchers, you know, 11 invoices, and, suddenly, each of those around one decision, they magically become, instead of misdemeanors, they become a felony. And if they're misdemeanor… MARGARET BRENNAN: Because of the election fraud, as – as you just heard. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: Well, but if – well, but if – if – I don't know that anybody in America – if we're asking about the voter, I don't know if anybody American can explain how a – business transaction filing errors from seven years ago become federal election law, when federal election law is not a state. This was brought in a county court. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: Federal election is federal. And I don't know the alchemy of transforming these misdemeanors, which had a two-year statute of limitations – what I'm saying, from a business perspective, CEOs around America… MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: … if you've had hundreds of millions of business filings in America in the last seven years, why aren't our courts clogged with other CEOs that were dragged in front of… MARGARET BRENNAN: If they were running for president and changing those business records to obscure donations to their own campaign – you know what I'm saying. This isn't just filing error. But… GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: Well, I – I hear what you're saying. But most Americans cannot explain it. Many – many of the legal experts… MARGARET BRENNAN: It's complicated, sure. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: Many of the legal experts that stood on the curb outside the courthouse for six years can't – for six weeks can't explain it. So Americans are going to come back to the issues that affect them, because this trial outcome doesn't affect them. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: Their – inflation affects them. MARGARET BRENNAN: It does. And I want to talk about some of those issues more in depth with you in a few minutes. We just put up a graph to – to show you our – our polling. It's two- thirds of those polled said they are watching closely. But in – in terms of, like, the bookkeeping argument, this was about a criminal conspiracy to influence an election and creating paperwork to cover it up. If the quibble is about paperwork violations, the president of the United States, his son, says, under the influence of drugs, he committed a paperwork error. That's now going to federal court because of what he did in purchasing that gun. That was a paperwork violation. Are you also offended by that? Is that also a miscarriage of justice? GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: Well, I think what's sad for America is the whole weaponization of the – the system. And what – we're going to see more of this. I mean, earlier in my life… MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think it's weaponized against Hunter Biden? GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: I think that is – is weaponized against President Trump. But if you're going to talk about equivalency in the courts, then we know that media companies have – have acknowledged that they worked in – in conjunction with the federal government to suppress information about Hunter Biden's laptop during an election year. MARGARET BRENNAN: That is not true whatsoever when it comes to this journalist or the journalists involved with this program. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: Well, then what – why were his – why were his stories about it taken down off of media companies? Why – why – why was it being suppressed during that election? Why – so – why – talk about the Steele dossier. I mean, we could go back. There – there is all kinds of things going on in our country related to election integrity. And I think, whether you're an independent, you're a Democrat, you're a Republican… MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: … we should all care about election integrity. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: And – and we – and if we want – if we want to have equivalency, then it – to make sure that we're – we have a level playing field. MARGARET BRENNAN: We have to finish this conversation on the other side of this commercial break. So let me do that and we'll finish it. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: Sure. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, stay with me, Governor. And stay with us one second. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Tune in on our streaming political show on CBS News 24/7 tomorrow. We will have a lot more from our poll on Trump's guilty verdict. America Decides airs weekdays at 5:00 p.m. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation and Governor Burgum. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We want to continue our conversation now with North Dakota Republican Governor Doug Burgum. Governor, North Dakota has tremendous energy resources. And you reportedly are helping the Trump campaign craft energy policy. That's accurate? GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM (R-ND): Well, I wouldn't say that. I'm just saying that I'm volunteering to support President Trump during this campaign because, as an energy rich state full of natural resources, and I've had the honor of being a governor under President Trump - MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: And also under President Biden. And I see the difference between the two administrations. And I've got a front row seat in understanding that the - the Biden energy policies are, you know, hard on the American consumers. They're empowering adversaries overseas and they're - they're really tough on our allies. MARGARET BRENNAN: There - there is more oil being produced in this country now than any country ever, 13 million barrels per day last year. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: Yes, and North Dakota's down and Iran is up under these policies. And the policies are built around the idea that somehow, if you shut down the U.S. energy industry, that - that that's going to be good for the environment. But when we stop production here, because it may be higher than it has been before by a little bit – MARGARET BRENNAN: It has - it is. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: But it should be much higher because we should be displacing energy coming from Venezuela, coming from Iran, coming from Russia. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let me ask you about that. Let me - let me ask you about that. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: The people that are funding the was that we're fighting are doing that on their oil sales. MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you that. Is - according to ""The Washington Post"" and their reporting, Donald Trump met with oil executives and said, if they raise a billion dollars to return him to the White House, he'll reduce regulation if elected, start auctioning off leases for drilling in - GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: I was at that meeting. I was at that meeting. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: That did not happen. That is not what happened at that meeting. And that's been reported over and over and over again. MARGARET BRENNAN: Did he ask for a billion dollars in donations? GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: He didn't ask for a billion dollars in donations, and there was no quid pro quo. I mean, think what he did last time for the energy - this guy cut regulation for everybody, whether they donated to him or not. He helped get gas prices down for all Americans, Republicans, independents and Democrats, whether they donated to him or not. It drives me crazy when - MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the economy was also shut down due to Covid, which lowered prices too. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: It drives me - when people went on - people went on hearsay that weren't at the meeting on hearsay report it like it's a fact, when it's not a fact. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I'm asking you to make sure. ""The Washington Post"" also reported that Trump suggested to those oil executives he would ease scrutiny of industry mergers and acquisitions if he wins. Do you think that the industry needs to consolidate and big oil needs to get bigger? GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: I think that the free enterprise needs to operate at ways that are efficiently to be able to compete on a global - on a global level. And what's going on in the industry – MARGARET BRENNAN: So, he would do that? GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: I'm not saying he would do that. But I tell you what - what Joe Biden's administration is doing right now, two companies want to merge, and then they come in and then they, what, they confiscate all the executives' phone numbers ahead of time, make accusations about collusions. This has never happened to another industry. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, what was promised in that meeting since you said you were there? GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: He - he didn't make promises. He listened. He went around the room for two hours asking each of the people to tell me, what are your challenges, what are you facing, what are the - what are the things - he was there learning the whole night about the challenges that we're facing. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, is he targeting the industry to finance his re- election bid? GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: I think anybody he's met with - he'll be meeting with people in Silicon Valley. He's meeting people in - across every industry. He's not targeting anybody, he's doing what candidates do, which is, you go and listen to an industry. And this industry in particular, which is the fundamental to the entire economy. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: It's not just one industry. It feeds the inflation, which is affecting every American. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: To say, what can we do to produce cleaner energy, more efficiently? President Trump talks all the time about getting oil prices down. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: Oil executives are not thrilled when he says, I'm going to get oil prices down. You know, they - they make more money when oil prices are up. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, OK. So, climate and - and environmental policy are important to young voters in particular. Are you at all concerned that you will alienate them by aligning so closely with the energy industry? GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: Well, I'm not concerned about it at all because I know in North Dakota we're - we - we are producing energy cleaner, safer and smarter than any place else in the world here in the United States - MARGARET BRENNAN: So you do want to keep some of the environmental restrictions then? GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: The environmental restrictions are hurting this country, they're not helping it. If the innovation - MARGARET BRENNAN: (INAUDIBLE). GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: People that think that you're going to solve the environmental issues with regulations, the way we solve that is with innovation. And the way we solve it with innovation is, we innovate to have zero carbon liquid fuels or low carbon liquid fuels. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. GOVERNOR DOUG BURGUM: The Biden administration is on team China. They want to have every car be an EV, and then we've got to get - China controls 85 percent of the rare earth minerals. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, but they just tariff them. Would talk to you for an hour about rare earth minerals, sir. We'll have to have you come back another time to talk about that global competition. But we're going to have to leave it there and turn to one of the crises right now out of the Middle East with the Israel-Hamas conflict. Joining us is Scott Anderson. He is the director of the U.N.'s refugee efforts in Gaza. UNRWA is the largest relief agency for Palestinian refugees. And he joins us right now from Aman, Jordan. Scott, I know you were in the U.S. Army. You served two tours in Afghanistan. From what you've seen in Gaza, how does it compare? I'm sorry, I cannot hear Scott right now. SCOTT ANDERSON (Director, UNRWA Affairs Gaza): Sorry. MARGARET BRENNAN: There you go. SCOTT ANDERSON: I was going to say, Gaza is much worse, Margaret, than Afghanistan was. I mean everywhere you go, the scale of destruction just really defies description. And it looks like something out of an apocalyptic movie. Most places you're looking at 90 to 100 percent destruction with the infrastructure suffering much worse. So, I never saw anything quite like that in Afghanistan that we're seeing now in Gaza. MARGARET BRENNAN: The USAID chief, Sam Power - Samantha Power, said, conditions are worse now in Gaza than ever before. She said that was due to the Israeli military operations and closed crossings. What exactly is the humanitarian situation right now? SCOTT ANDERSON: So, what you have is 2.2 million people that have all been displaced at least once. Most have been displaced multiple times. In Rafah, ahead of the operation, we had over a million people again displaced, Khan Yunis to Karabela (ph). And what they're lacking is really just the basic necessities that we all kind of expect. They need food. They need access to water. They need access to showers, access to toilets, access to medical care. And, unfortunately, because of a variety of factors, we're unable to import everything that's needed and to make sure that everybody has the basic necessities that they need to get through every day. MARGARET BRENNAN: Nineteen different aid organizations released a letter this week saying Palestinians are surviving on less than 3 percent of their daily water needs. Hepatitis is spreading. Medical evacuations have been halted. Virtually every hospital has been issued evacuation orders. The Pentagon said it has suspended air drops of food because of the Israeli military action. And, as we know, the pier is not really operating. Who exactly is impeding the delivery? SCOTT ANDERSON: I think it's a variety of things, not just one person you can point to. All of the - the bulk of our aid comes in through Karam Shalam (ph). It all comes through Egypt. Starts at Port Saeed (ph), goes through the Siani Calarish (ph) and eventually makes its way to Karam Shalam, where it's brought in by us to the Palestinian side and then onward for the last mile distribution within Gaza. There's a lot of steps that have to go perfectly right for all that to work. And, unfortunately, not everything has gone right. For a time Egypt was not sending trucks where we had 80,000 metric tons of aid in a country we couldn't access. And - and we're - we've been perpetually playing catch- up on the aid situation since October. Not everybody has a tent that needs one. So you have people sleeping outside still as we're eight months after the start of the conflict. And you - you highlighted correctly our number one concern at this point, which is access to clean drinking water. You know, without that, in addition to hepatitis, you have things like cholera and other diseases that can become very prevalent and we could see an outbreak happen very soon. And it's something that concerns us. And, additionally, it's getting hot. You know, it's summer. It's essentially you're in the desert. And if people don't have access to clean drinking water, that's a problem for dehydration, as well as for disease. MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you are with the U.N. so you can't talk about politics and policy, but President Biden did make this address Friday talking about a proposal for a cease-fire and hostage deal. He said it would come with 600 aid trucks per day to enter Gaza with supplies, with shelter, and the like. Who's going to be doing all of that distribution? SCOTT ANDERSON: I mean that would be the entire international humanitarian community because of the scale. I mean currently, UNRWA feeds a little over half the population. We're feeding about 1.3 or 1.4 million people every day. But it would be us, along with the rest of the U.N. and all our partners. And I would say, we very much welcome a cease-fire. It's time for the hostages to go home to their families. Time for more aid to start coming in and then hopefully we can start rebuilding Gaza. MARGARET BRENNAN: Scott Anderson, thank you for telling us what you are seeing and experiencing on the ground. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by the former commander of U.S. forces in the Middle East, retired General Frank McKenzie. His new book, ""The Melting Point,"" is available this Tuesday. Good to see you, sir. GENERAL FRANK MCKENZIE (Ret., Former Commander of U.S. Central Command and Author, ""The Melting Point""): Good to be here, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, on Friday, President Biden said that Hamas is no longer capable of carrying out another October 7th. When you were last with us in February, you said Israel's success has been very limited. Do you think they can declare success now? GENERAL FRANK MCKENZIE: I think they're a lot closer than they were a few months ago. I still think Hamas political and military leadership exists largely whole. A lot of their combat formations have been destroyed. But I think Hamas has been significantly atritted (ph). MARGARET BRENNAN: You also have raised a few times in the past few months concerns about America's continued presence in the Middle East, which you say is crucial here. Right now we are seeing so many different flash points. One of them in the Red Sea, where our CBS' David Martin reported the U.S. used a 5,000 pound bunker buster bomb in Yemen just this past week. The Houthis are attacking shipping. We have concerns about the troop safety in Syria and in Iraq. Does it need to continue? GENERAL FRANK MCKENZIE: Well, I think we remain the critical nation in the Middle East. I think everybody looks at us to be the honest broker. If we take the situation with the Houthis as simply one example, I would argue that we've been too passive. We've allowed the Houthis really to dominate global maritime communications by closing down effectively the Suez Canal. And that is something that's not only bad for the United States, but for many other nations around the world. It has nothing to do actually with Israel or the conflict in Gaza. Rather, it's a larger principle for the United States. But we've essentially been catching and not pitching in this conflict despite deploying multibillion-dollar warships into the Red Sea. The sign that we're dropping larger bombs may be a good thing, but we need to go after the source of the attacks. And the source of the attacks is Houthi leadership and command and control facilities in Yemen. And I would argue that the threat of escalation is very small if we conduct these attacks. MARGARET BRENNAN: When you say we, you think the Biden administration? GENERAL FRANK MCKENZIE: I think the United States and our allies. MARGARET BRENNAN: You largely try to avoid politics and directly addressing the presidents you served under in the book that you wrote here, but you have had such a key role in some of these very significant national security decisions, killing the ISIS commander, Baghdadi, taking Qassem Soleimani off the battlefield, executing the withdrawal from Afghanistan. And you spread around some blame to past U.S. presidents. But you do point to the Doha agreement, the withdraw negotiated by the Trump administration, as one of the worst negotiating mistakes ever made by the U.S. Why? GENERAL FRANK MCKENZIE: I think it was. And it was – and also, by the way, we implemented the agreement. Had we actually stuck to the strict terms of the agreement, we might have been able to make something of it. But, in fact, we treated the Doha agreement as a schedule for us to depart Afghanistan. And that policy objective remained across two presidents, President Trump and President Biden. When, in fact, there are procedures in the Doha agreement, if we had respected them, that would require the Taliban to do certain things in return. We did not require that. And, effectively, I would argue, that the Doha agreement was the operational mechanism that killed Afghanistan, that destroyed the government of Afghanistan, because they saw we were eager to leave, regardless of cost, and that was a very important and deflating thing, I think, for the government of Afghanistan. MARGARET BRENNAN: As you point out, that was across two presidents. GENERAL FRANK MCKENZIE: Absolutely. MARGARET BRENNAN: Biden and Trump? GENERAL FRANK MCKENZIE: Margaret, I would argue that President Trump and President Biden, was (INAUDIBLE) as any two presidents in our history, but they both shared a policy objective of leaving Afghanistan, regardless really of the consequences. MARGARET BRENNAN: You wrote that you drafted resignation letters a few times, but the only time you actually came close was after that withdraw from Afghanistan and a drone strike August 29th that was intended to kill ISIS but killed civilians. If you had such strong objections, why was that the moment where you almost resigned and not others? GENERAL FRANK MCKENZIE: So, I feel it's very important that generals don't resign over policy differences. That's not good for the republic. It's not the way that our military system should work. And, historically, it's not the way it has worked back to the Korean War, back to the Second World War. Many generals - many senior generals disagreed with presidential decisions, but they did not resign. So, I did not feel it was appropriate to resign. In my particular case, if there had been discussions of charging my subordinates, that I felt it was necessary for me to actually accept part of that blame. Now, we did not do that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. You stayed on. You, in the book, talk quite a lot about conversations you had around how to implement the withdraw from Afghanistan and the planning for it, particularly with the Trump administration. At one point you say the chief of staff to President Trump, Mark Meadows, advised not to present certain options out of concern he'd choose them, like going to zero in Afghanistan. You wrote, Trump made the decision to kill Qassem Soleimani, but his national security advisors were telling him there won't be any consequences for it, which is not what U.S. intelligence said and that is not what U.S. CENTCOM thought. Why is it important for the public to know that the people around the commanders in chief were either not sharing full picture with him or changing what he was allowed to see? GENERAL FRANK MCKENZIE: Well, every president, whether it - the last - either the last two have advisors that give them all kinds of different opinions. The military input that comes in is one part of that. And that was my - and I was relentlessly focused on that. Every president also has to make political calculations, not just these two presidents, but presidents as far back as President Roosevelt in the Second World War had to balance internal U.S. political objectives with what was going on around the world. So, that's not new or unusual in these times. I think in the case of Qassem Soleimani, I think President Trump made the right decision. I do not believe ultimately we made the right decision in Afghanistan. And I've been pretty clear about that in open - in open testimony. And that goes across two presidents. MARGARET BRENNAN: But it is cherry-picking, right, information to present to the commander in chief when he has to make a call. And you write about the internessing (ph) bickering you say and finger-pointing that followed Trump political appointees at the Pentagon. You wrote about the choice of drawing down the 2,500 troops. You say you don't even know where that number came from. It was kind of arbitrary. And there was an incident in which a mysterious signed letter appeared saying withdraw from Afghanistan. And you hunted that down and it was ultimately discarded. How does something like that happen with such high consequence, and do you fear that it could happen again if there is a second Trump administration? GENERAL FRANK MCKENZIE: Well, Margaret, I think the period of time from the presidential election of 2021, until the inauguration of 2022, was a particularly dangerous time inside the Pentagon. And I believe there that that's where the U.S. military has a role to play. It's a non-political role. It's a role where we answer the orders that we're given. And, at the same time, you have political appointees inside the Pentagon, they're appointed by the president and members of his party, and they have their own objectives there. And we respond to orders from the chain of command. It's very important to know who can actually give orders and who can't give orders. A lot of people that walk around the Pentagon are not in a position to give orders. The orders flow from the president to the secretary to the combatant commanders. Everyone else has an opinion, and those opinions may actually impact the decisions that are made, but they're not in the chain of command. MARGARET BRENNAN: General, it is a fascinating read. Thank you for coming on to talk about the book. GENERAL FRANK MCKENZIE: Thanks, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now with - by Matt Pottinger, who served as deputy national security adviser in the Trump administration. He is the author of the new book ""The Boiling Moat: Urgent Steps to Defend Taiwan,"" available in July. Matt, you say the clock's ticking. Beijing has been engaged in the most comprehensive peacetime military buildup of any nation since World War II."" Are you predicting that conflict will happen either on President Biden or President Trump, if he's re-elected, on their watch? MATT POTTINGER (Former Deputy National Security Adviser and Author, ""The Boiling Moat: Urgent Steps to Defend Taiwan"": Well, what is clear is that the dictator in Beijing, Xi Jinping, intends to try to take Taiwan, to annex it, by force if necessary. We also know that this would be catastrophic for American prosperity and security. But my co-authors and I are actually quite optimistic that this is a war that can be deterred, but it means that we've got to take some steps urgently. These are workable steps. It doesn't require massive new investment. We've got the technologies we need. But Taiwan, Japan and the United States in particular, need to take the steps that we think we've laid out in the book. MARGARET BRENNAN: This week the defense secretary is in Asia. And he actually met with his Chinese defense minister counterpart. You can see it there. This is like the first meeting since 2022. Last guy disappeared. MATT POTTINGER: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: But Austin said, a fight with China is neither imminent or unavoidable. When we hear the kind of rhetoric out of Washington right now, it sounds like we are headed towards conflict. What are the things you're saying need to be done to avoid it? MATT POTTINGER: Yes. Well, for starters, we need to invest more in munitions making. OK, so one of the things that the Chinese government is looking at is, would we be able to stay in a fight more than just the first, you know, the initial battle that would be involved in taking Taiwan? If they don't think we have the industrial base - and right now we haven't optimized our industrial base to do that - we're - MARGARET BRENNAN: Even with the national security supplemental investment in (INAUDIBLE)? MATT POTTINGER: Absolutely. Look, we - we - amazingly, I don't think many Americans realize, our defense spending right now is less than half of what it was in the 1980s during the Cold War. And that was during the Reagan administration. We didn't have to go to war, partly because we put the money into that. Our military, in terms of manpower, is smaller today than it was on the eve of World War II. So, we have to put more money into it. It's - it's - but we also have to do things to optimize our defense spending so that it's not guaranteed profits, no matter how inefficient the manufacturers are. There are things that we can do to super charge our military manufacturing to take advantage of our innovative base. MARGARET BRENNAN: It's interesting to hear you and before you the general talk about the scale of the problem set facing the president of the United States and the next commander in chief. So, that's why I think it's important to have this conversation this week. You did resign from the Trump administration after the violent attack on the Capitol on January the 6th. You then testified to Congress that you feared America's national security was in harm that day. That it gave ammunition to feed a narrative that our system of government doesn't work, the U.S. is in decline. If you continue to contest an election, you're not just contesting an election, you're actually challenging the Constitution itself. Do you fear that erosion is taking place right now with what we are hearing on the campaign trail? MATT POTTINGER: Well, look, I think the perception of erosion is. I actually think the United States is incredibly strong. We have all of these advantages. The century can be ours if we don't lose our nerve. I think that - look, Election Day will be a referendum. It's the best kind of referendum. It's where the American people get to decide who the next president's going to be. I hope that the outcome is decisive so that we don't end up with either side challenging the results. But if they do, just like with the last election, the courts will determine it. We have a system in place that allows us to adjudicate the outcomes of our elections. MARGARET BRENNAN: But now you even have like the ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee coming out and repeating things that undercut our judicial system. MATT POTTINGER: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Comparing the United States to the Soviet Union? MATT POTTINGER: Yes. Well, look, there - there's no way that - MARGARET BRENNAN: What does Beijing think of that? Because it - MATT POTTINGER: Yes, look - look - well, Beijing, it's kind of an interesting moment because Beijing really relishes propaganda that is designed to discredit the United States or to cause us to doubt our - our system of government. But at the same time, you have a jury that is just convicted a president of the United States. You've also got the son of a sitting president, who's - who's now under indictment, just like you heard from Preet Bharara earlier. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. MATT POTTINGER: Beijing's propaganda can only go so far. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. MATT POTTINGER: At the end of the day, Americans, thank God, we live in a system where the American people are going to decide who their president is. They're doing - they - they have - MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. MATT POTTINGER: All the information available to them. MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will try to bring - bring it to them here.

Frank McKenzie on ""Face the Nation,"" June 2, 2024",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/frank-mckenzie-former-centcom-commander-middle-east-face-the-nation-transcript-06-02-2024/,"The following is a transcript of an interview with former commander of U.S. forces in the Middle East, retired General Frank McKenzie, on ""Face the Nation"" that aired on June 2, 2024.","The following is a transcript of an interview with former commander of U.S. forces in the Middle East, retired General Frank McKenzie, on ""Face the Nation"" that aired on June 2, 2024. MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by the former commander of US forces in the Middle East, retired General Frank McKenzie. His new book The Melting Point is available this Tuesday. Good to see you, sir. FORMER COMMANDER OF US FORCES IN THE MIDDLE EAST GENERAL FRANK MCKENZIE: Good to be here. MARGARET BRENNAN: So on Friday, President Biden said that Hamas is no longer capable of carrying out another October 7. When you were last with us in February, you said Israel's success has been very limited. Do you think they can declare success now? GEN. MCKENZIE: I think they're a lot closer than they were a few months ago. I still think Hamas political and military leadership exists largely whole. A lot of their combat formations have been destroyed. But I think Hamas has been significantly attritted. MARGARET BRENNAN: You also have raised a few times in the past few months concerns about America's continued presence in the Middle East which you say is crucial here. Right now, we are seeing so many different flashpoints, one of them in the Red Sea where our CBS' David Martin reported the US used a 5,000 pound bunker buster bomb in Yemen just this past week. Houthis are attacking shipping. We have concerns about the troop safety in Syria and in Iraq. Does it need to continue? GEN. MCKENZIE: Well, I think we remain the critical nation in the Middle East. I think everybody looks to us to be the honest broker. If we take the situation with the Houthis as simply one example, I would argue that we've been too passive. We've allowed the Houthis really to dominate global maritime communications by closing down, effectively, the Suez Canal. And that is something that's not only bad for the United States but for many other nations around the world. Has nothing to do actually with Israel or the conflict in Gaza. Rather, it's a larger principle for the United States. But we've essentially been catching and not pitching in this conflict despite deploying multibillion dollar warships into the Red Sea. The sign that we're dropping larger bombs may be a good thing, but we need to go after the source of the attacks. And the source of the attacks is Houthi leadership and command and control facilities in Yemen. And I would argue that the threat of escalation is very small if we conduct these attacks. MARGARET BRENNAN: When you say 'we', you think the Biden administration. GEN. MCKENZIE: I think the United States and our allies. MARGARET BRENNAN: You largely try to avoid politics and directly addressing the presidents you served under in the book that you wrote here. But you have had such a key role in some of these very significant national security decisions: killing the ISIS commander Baghdadi, taking Qasem Soleimani off the battlefield, executing the withdrawal from Afghanistan. And you spread around some blame to past US presidents. But you do point to the Doha Agreement, the withdrawal negotiated by the Trump administration as one of the worst negotiating mistakes ever made by the US. GEN. MCKENZIE: I think it was. And it was- and also by the way, we implemented the agreement. Had we actually stuck to the strict terms of the agreement, we might have been able to make something of it. But in fact, we treated the Doha Agreement as a schedule for us to depart Afghanistan. And that policy objective remained across two presidents, President Trump and President Biden, when in fact there were procedures in the Doha Agreement if we had respected them that would require the Taliban to do certain things in return. We did not require that. And effectively, I would argue that the Doha Agreement was the operational mechanism that killed Afghanistan, that destroyed the government of Afghanistan because they saw we were eager to leave regardless of cost. And that was a very important and deflating thing, I think, for the government of Afghanistan. MARGARET BRENNAN: But as you point out, that was across two presidents- GEN. MCKENZIE: Absolutely. MARGARET BRENNAN: Biden and Trump. GEN. MCKENZIE: Margaret, I would argue that President Trump and President Biden were as unalike as any two presidents in our history, but they both shared a policy objective of leaving Afghanistan regardless, really, of consequences. MARGARET BRENNAN: You wrote the- you drafted resignation letters a few times, but the only time you actually came close was after that withdrawal from Afghanistan and a drone strike August 29 that was intended to kill ISIS but killed civilians. If you had such strong objections, why was that the moment where you almost resigned and not others? GEN. MCKENZIE: So I feel it's very important that generals don't resign over policy differences. That's not good for the Republic. It's not the way that our military system should work. And historically, it's not the way it has worked back to the Korean War, back to the Second World War. Many generals, many senior generals disagreed with presidential decisions, but they did not resign. So I did not feel it was appropriate to resign. In my particular case, if there had been discussions of charging my subordinates, then I felt it was necessary for me to actually accept part of that blame. Now we did not do that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. You stayed on. You in the book talk quite a lot about conversations you had around how to implement the withdrawal from Afghanistan and the planning for it, particularly with the Trump administration. At one point, you say the Chief of Staff to President Trump, Mark Meadows, advised not to present certain options out of concern he'd choose them, like going to zero in Afghanistan. You wrote Trump made the decision to kill Qasem Soleimani, but his national security advisors were telling him, 'There won't be any consequences for it,' which is not what US Intelligence said, and that is not what US CENTCOM thought. Why is it important for the public to know that the people around the commander-in-chief were either not sharing the full picture with him or changing what he was allowed to see? GEN. MCKENZIE: Well, every president whether the- either the last two- have advisors that give him all kinds of different opinions. The military input that comes in is one part of that. And that was my- I was relentlessly focused on that. Every president also has to make political calculations, not just these two presidents, but presidents as far back as President Roosevelt in the Second World War had to balance internal US political objectives with what was going on around the world. So that's not new or unusual in these times. I think in the case of Qasem Soleimani, I think President Trump made the right decision. I do not believe ultimately we made the right decision in Afghanistan, and I've been pretty clear about that in open, in open testimony, and that goes across two presidents. MARGARET BRENNAN: But it is cherry picking, right, information to present to the commander-in-chief when he has to make a call, and you write about the internecine bickering, you say, and finger pointing that followed Trump political appointees at the Pentagon. You wrote- about the choice of drawing down to 2500 troops, you say you don't even know where that number came from. It was kind of arbitrary. And there was an incident in which a mysterious signed letter appeared saying- withdraw from Afghanistan, and you hunted that down and it was ultimately discarded. How does something like that happen, with such high consequence, and do you fear that it could happen again if there is a second Trump administration? MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Margaret, I think the period of time from the presidential election of 2021 until the inauguration in 2022 was a particularly dangerous time inside the Pentagon. And I believe they're that that's where the US military has a role to play. It's a non-political role. It's a role where we answer the orders that were given. And at the same time, you have political appointees inside the Pentagon that are appointed by the president, members of his party, and they have their own objectives there. And we respond to orders from the chain of command. It's very important to know who can actually give orders and who can't give orders. A lot of people that walk around the Pentagon are not in a position to give orders. The orders flow from the president to the secretary to the combatant commanders. Everyone else has an opinion and those opinions may actually impact the decisions that are made, but they're not in the chain of command. MARGARET BRENNAN: General, it is a fascinating read. Thank you for coming on to talk about the book. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thanks, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back. ",CBSnews,US
Donald Trump joins TikTok after reversal on app he tried to ban as president,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-joins-tiktok-reversal/,"While in office, Trump took issue with the social media app being controlled by a China-based parent company, trying unsuccessfully to ban the app in the U.S. with an executive order.","Washington — Former President Donald Trump has joined TikTok, posting for the first time Saturday on the widely popular video-sharing app controlled by a Chinese parent company that he once tried to ban in the U.S. ""It's my honor,"" Trump said in the video, which features Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White, who declared that ""the president is now on TikTok."" The video, which had garnered more than 2 million likes by Sunday afternoon, features clips from Trump's attendance at the UFC match in Newark, New Jersey, on Saturday, where he was greeted by supporters after being convicted in the New York ""hush money"" trial on all 34 felony counts days earlier. While in office, Trump took issue with the social media app being controlled by a China-based parent company, trying unsuccessfully to ban the app in the U.S. with an executive order. Earlier this year, a renewed push against the app gained momentum in Congress, as lawmakers approved a foreign aid package that included a provision that required its sale within a year or a ban from U.S. app stores. But before Congress approved and President Biden signed the legislation that could lead to a ban on TikTok into law, Trump changed his tune. He argued that banning TikTok would benefit Facebook, which he called the ""true Enemy of the People."" Trump's super PAC joined TikTok last month, despite his previous views. At the time, Taylor Budowich, the CEO of MAGA Inc., said in a post on X that ""we will ensure President Trump's America First agenda is brought to every corner of the internet and every precinct of this country."" The development comes months after Mr. Biden's reelection campaign launched its own account on TikTok, despite his administration's support for the legislation that could lead to a ban. For both campaigns, the app presents an opportunity to reach young voters, who will be a key demographic in November's election.

"Burgum on Trump verdict: ""The election is not gonna turn on this trial""",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/doug-burgum-trump-trial-2024-election-face-the-nation/,"North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a contender for Donald Trump's running mate, said Sunday that November's election will not be decided by the former president's guilty conviction in the New York ""hush money"" trial.","Washington — North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, considered to be one of the contenders to be Donald Trump's running mate, said Sunday that November's election will not be decided by the former president's guilty conviction in the New York ""hush money"" trial. ""While this is interesting and it's captivating right now to a lot of people, the election is not gonna turn on this trial,"" Burgum said on ""Face the Nation"" Sunday. A Manhattan jury last week found Trump guilty of falsifying business records to conceal a $130,000 payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels to buy her silence before the 2016 presidential election. But Republicans have derided the verdict, sticking by their presumptive nominee for president and claiming that the jury was biased, although the jury was composed of seven men and five women who were all approved by both the defense and the prosecution. Burgum echoed the skepticism in the verdict, while asserting that Americans haven't been paying close attention to the trial. He argued that working Americans don't have time to keep up with the details of the trial, and he suggested that it won't have a major impact on the electorate come November. ""As this moment in time passes, when we have the election coming this fall, people are going to make a decision about, are they better off today than they were four years ago?"" Burgum said, noting that Americans already had a chance to live their lives under a Trump administration. ""Americans are gonna come back to the issues that affect them because this trial outcome doesn't affect them, the inflation affects them."" According to a CBS News poll conducted after the verdict, just over a third of Americans said they had been following the news about the Trump trial and conviction ""very closely."" The survey also found that just over half of Americans think the jury reached the right verdict and that the trial was fair, which is virtually unchanged from the portion of the country that thought Trump was guilty before the verdict. And Republicans overwhelmingly said they think that Trump was treated unfairly, a sentiment that he and his surrogates have touted for months. Burgum was among a group of Republican officials who appeared at the Manhattan courthouse in the days leading up to the verdict to support the former president. Though the North Dakota governor had launched a long-shot bid for the White House, he bowed out of the race in December and later endorsed Trump. Since then, he's become a major advocate for the former president and is thought to be among the contenders for Trump's running mate. When asked about reporting from The Washington Post that Trump met with oil executives and told them that if they raise $1 billion to help him return to the White House, he would reduce regulation and start auctioning off drilling leases, Burgum backed up the former president. ""I was at that meeting. That did not happen,"" Burgum said. ""He didn't ask for a billion dollars in donations and there was no quid pro quo."" The Washington Post also reported that Trump suggested to those oil executives he would ease scrutiny of industry, mergers and acquisitions if he wins, which Burgum also denied. But when asked what did happen at the meeting, Burgum said Trump ""went around the room for two hours, asking each of the people to tell me, what are your challenges? What are you facing? What are- what are the things that- he was there learning the whole night about the challenges that we're facing."" But Burgum insisted that Trump isn't ""targeting"" the oil industry to finance his reelection bid, although he added that current environmental restrictions are ""hurting this country.""

Doug Burgum on ""Face the Nation,"" June 2, 2024",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/doug-burgum-north-dakota-governor-face-the-nation-transcript-06-02-2024/,"The following is a transcript of an interview with North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum on ""Face the Nation"" that aired on June 2, 2024.","The following is a transcript of an interview with North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum on ""Face the Nation"" that aired on June 2, 2024. MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum. Based on our CBS News reporting, he is under serious consideration by the former president to become his running mate in this campaign. Good morning to you, Governor. GOV. DOUG BURGUM (R-ND): Good morning, Margaret. Good to be with you. MARGARET BRENNAN: It's good to have you back on ""Face the Nation."" You just heard our polling there. 57% Americans think the jury reached the right verdict. 56% think Trump got a fair trial. A majority of Americans are unconvinced by this claim that it's all a sham. Why do you think it is? GOV. BURGUM: Well, I think part of it, of course, polling is a point in time and I had a chance to briefly look at some of your poll numbers this morning. And I also saw there that almost two thirds of the respondents said they weren't paying close attention. And I understand that they're not paying close attention to the trial, because most Americans out there, you know, they've got- working Americans don't have time to watch, you know, TV all day, read every report, because they're facing all the things, you know, putting food on the table, gas in the car, all the challenges that they're facing. And I think that as this moment in time passes, when we have the election coming this fall, people are going to make a decision about, were they better, are they better off today than they were four years ago? And this is an unusual thing, that- this is not- President Trump's not a candidate that's unknown or never run before. They had an opportunity to live their life under four years of him. And they had a chance to, you know, prosper. And they had a chance to understand what the world was like. No wars. And now that- it's a very different situation. So I- I think well, this is- it's interesting, and it's captivating right now to a lot of people, the election is not going to turn on this trial. MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S. isn't involved in a war right now, either. But, in-- GOV. BURGUM: Well, we're involved in two proxy wars. MARGARET BRENNAN: We were then as well. But on- on your point, Donald Trump spends a lot of time talking about these trials. It- it's not just journalists. And it's historic. But he talks quite a lot about it. And, in fact, he held an extensive news conference Friday with a litany of grievances against the judge, who will still have to decide on his sentencing. Personal judgment wise, do you think that was a smart thing to do? GOV. BURGUM: Well, I have a lot of empathy for what he must feel like, and- because as a business person, I- and I- someone who spent- and I spent 30 years in tech, but a lot of that was in software that dealt with business processes, I've- I've never seen anything like this, where you can, you know, magically take, you know, a transaction that gets spread out over 11- 11 paychecks, or paychecks- 12 vouchers, you know, 11 invoices, and suddenly each of those around one decision, they magically become set of misdemeanors, they become a felony. And if they're misdemean-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Because of the election fraud. That- as you just heard. GOV. BURGUM: Well- but- I don't know that anybody in America, if we're asking about the voter, I don't know if anybody American can explain how a business transaction filing, errors from 7 years ago, become federal election law, when federal election law is not a state, this is brought in a county court. Federal election is federal. And I don't know the alchemy of transforming these misdemeanors, which had a two year statute of limitations. Well, I'm saying from a business perspective, CEOs around America, if you've had hundreds of millions of business filings in America in the last 7 years, why aren't our courts clogged with other CEOs that were dragged in front of-- MARGARET BRENNAN: If they were running for president and changing those business records to obscure donations to their own campaign- you know what I'm saying, this isn't just filing error. But-- GOV. BURGUM: Well, I- I hear what you're saying. But most Americans cannot explain it. Many of the legal experts-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Should- it's complicated. Sure. GOV. BURGUM: Many of the legal experts that stood on the curb outside the courthouse for 6 years can't- for 6 weeks, can't explain it. So Americans are going to come back to the issues that affect them because this trial outcome doesn't affect them. Their- inflation affects them-- MARGARET BRENNAN: It does. And I want to talk about some of those issues more in depth with you in a few minutes. We just put up a graph to- to show you our- our polling, it's two thirds of those polled said they are watching closely. But in- in terms of like, the bookkeeping argument, this was about a criminal conspiracy to influence an election and creating paperwork to cover it up. If the quibble is about paperwork violations, the president of the United States, his son, says, under the influence of drugs, he committed a paperwork error. That's now going to federal court because of what he did in purchasing that gun. That was a paperwork violation. Are you also offended by that? Is that also a miscarriage of justice? GOV. BURGUM: Well, I think what's sad for America is the whole weaponization of the- the system. And what we're going to see more of this, I mean, earlier in-- MARGARET BRENNAN: You think it's weaponized against Hunter Biden? GOV. BURGUM: I think that is- is weaponized against President Trump. But if you're going to talk about equivalency in the courts, then we know that media companies have- have acknowledged that they worked in- in conjunction with the federal government to suppress information about Hunter Biden's laptop during an election year. MARGARET BRENNAN: That is not true whatsoever when it comes to this journalist or the journalists involved with this program. GOV. BURGUM: Well, then why was- why were his stories about it taken down off of media companies? Why- why- why was it being suppressed during that election? Why- so- why- talking about the Steele dossier, I mean, we could go back. There- there is all kinds of things going on in our country related to election integrity, and I think whether you're an independent, you're a Democrat, you're a Republican, we should all care about election integrity. And- and we- and if we want- if we want to have equivalency, then- it- to make sure that we have a level playing field. MARGARET BRENNAN: We have to finish this conversation on the other side of this commercial break. So let me do that and we'll finish it. So stay with me, Governor, and stay with us. One second. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to ""Face the Nation."" We want to continue our conversation now with North Dakota Republican governor, Doug Burgum. Governor, North Dakota has tremendous energy resources, and you reportedly are helping the Trump campaign craft energy policy. That's accurate? GOV. BURGUM: Well, I wouldn't say that. I'm just saying that I'm volunteering to support President Trump during this campaign, because as an energy rich state full of natural resources. And I've had the honor of being a governor under President Trump and also under President Biden. And I see the difference between the two administrations. And I've got a front row seat in understanding that the- the Biden energy policies are, you know, hard on the American consumers, they're empowering adversaries overseas, and they're really tough on our allies. MARGARET BRENNAN: There- there is more oil being produced in this country now than any country ever. 13 million barrels per day last year. GOV. BURGUM: Yeah, and North Dakota is down and Iran is up under these policies. And the policies are built around the idea that somehow if you shut down the U.S. energy industry, that- that that's gonna be good for the environment. But when we stop production here, it may be higher than it has been before-- (CROSSTALK) MARGARET BRENNAN: It has- it is. GOV. BURGUM: --by a- a little bit. But it should be much higher, because we should be displacing energy coming from Venezuela-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let me ask you about that. Let me-- GOV. BURGUM: --coming from Iran, coming from Russia. MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about that. GOV. BURGUM: The people that are funding the wars that we're fighting are doing that on their oil sales. (END CROSSTALK) MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you that. Is- according to the ""Washington Post,"" and their reporting, Donald Trump met with oil executives and said, if they raise a billion dollars to return him to the White House, he'll reduce regulation if elected, start auctioning off leases for drilling-- GOV. BURGUM: I was at- I was at that meeting, that did not happen. That is not what happened at that meeting. And that's been reported over and over and over again-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Did he ask for a billion dollars in donations? GOV. BURGUM: He didn't ask for a billion dollars in donations, and there was no quid pro quo. I mean, think what he did last time for the energy- this guy cut regulation for everybody, whether they donated to him or not, he helped get gas prices down for all Americans, Republicans, independents and Democrats, whether they donated to him or not-- (CROSSTALK) MARGARET BRENNAN: Well-- GOV. BURGUM: --drives me crazy-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --the economy was also shut down-- GOV. BURGUM: --what- prices- the people went on- MARGARET BRENNAN: --due to covid- lower prices-- GOV. BURGUM: --people went to hearsay- that weren't at the meeting, on hearsay, report it like it's a fact, when it's not a fact. (END CROSSTALK) MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I'm asking you to make sure. The ""Washington Post"" also reported that Trump suggested to those oil executives he would ease scrutiny of industry, mergers and acquisitions if he wins. Do you think that the industry needs to consolidate and Big Oil needs to get bigger? GOV. BURGUM: I think that the- free enterprise needs to operate in ways that are efficiently to be able to compete on a global- on a global level and what's going on in the industry-- MARGARET BRENNAN: So he would do that. GOV. BURGUM: I'm not saying he would do that. But I tell you what- what Joe Biden's administration is doing right now. Two companies want to merge. And then they come in and then they, what, they confiscate all the executives' phone numbers ahead of time, make accusations about collusions. This has never happened to another industry. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, what was promised in that meeting, since you said you were there? GOV. BURGUM: He- he didn't make promises. He- listen, he went around the room for two hours, asking each of the people to tell me, what are your challenges? What are you facing? What are- what are the things that- he was there learning the whole night about the challenges that we're facing. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, is he targeting the industry to- to finance his reelection bid? GOV. BURGUM: I think anybody he's met with, he'll be meeting with people in Silicon Valley, he's meeting people in- across every industry. He's not targeting anybody. He's doing what candidates do, which is, you go and listen to an industry, and this industry in particular, which is the fundamental to the entire economy. It's not just one industry, it feeds the inflation which is affecting every American, to say, what can we do to produce cleaner energy more efficiently? President Trump talks all the time about getting oil prices down. Oil executives are not thrilled when he says, I'm going to get oil prices down. You know, they- they make more money when oil prices are up. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, so, climate and environmental policy are important to young voters in particular. Are you at all concerned that you will alienate them by aligning so closely with the energy industry? GOV. BURGUM: Well, I'm not concerned about it at all because I know in North Dakota, we're- we- we are producing energy cleaner, safer and smarter than anyplace else in the world here in the United States. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you do want to keep some of the environmental restrictions, then? GOV. BURGUM: The environmental restrictions are hurting this country, they're not helping it. If innovation- reg- people who think that you're going to solve the environmental issues with regulations, the way we solve that is with innovation. And the way we solve it with innovation is we innovate to have zero carbon liquid fuels or low carbon liquid fuels. The Biden administration is on Team China, they want to have every car be an EV. And then we got to get- China controls 85% of the rare earth minerals. MARGARET BRENNAN: But- but they just tariffed them- would talk to you for an hour about rare earth minerals, Sir, we'll have to have you come back another time to talk about that global competition. But we're gonna have to leave it there. ",CBSnews,US
"Ozempic craze can trigger complicated feelings for those who wished for ""magic fix""",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ozempic-craze-impacts-mental-health-weight-loss-magic-fix/,"Even if someone has gone through a healing process with body image or their relationship with food, these challenges can ""last a lifetime,"" a licensed mental health counselor tells CBS News.","While research has looked at the potential mental health impact of taking semaglutide drugs like Ozempic, less has been discussed on how the increase in these drugs are impacting those who aren't taking them. Heather Young said she's struggled with weight her entire life, telling CBS News that her teen years and early adulthood were filled with trying ""one thing after another only to fail again and again and again and just feel so defeated."" For people like her, the 37-year-old said, ""all we ever wanted was a magic fix. Instead, we were bombarded with diet culture, harmful pills, calorie counting and fad diet after fad diet."" Now, as medications like Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound have boomed in popularity for their use in weight loss, helping people and celebrities alike lose pounds fast, it's striking a complicated chord. ""My initial feelings were definitely complex,"" Young said of the craze. ""On one hand, I want everyone to be (their) best selves — physically, mentally and emotionally. And if there is a medication that makes that more obtainable for people, I am happy for them. But… I do think these drugs are being marketed as a magic fix, and it does trigger me."" Ozempic and Mounjaro,  both used for diabetes, and Wegovy and Zepbound, both approved for weight loss, are GLP-1 drugs, a class of medicines that signal fullness to the brain and regulate blood sugar. Dr. Rekha Kumar, an obesity specialist and chief medical officer at weight loss app Found, previously told CBS News these drugs are ""a scientific breakthrough."" ""Not just because of weight control, but because of cardiovascular risk reduction (and) treating diabetes. People are actually getting healthier, and that's the point of medicine. It isn't just to be thinner,"" Kumar said. Though she acknowledged being thinner is what is causing buzz — and that concerns her. ""We're seeing people want to get ahold of these medicines that don't need them at all - people trying to fit into dresses, and wanting to lose the vanity weight,"" she said. ""And that's not really what these were made for."" The buzz has also created high demand, prompting companies like Costco and Hims & Hers to get in on the GLP-1 boom as well as dangerous counterfeits that have popped up on social media. Young isn't alone in her feelings, either. Victoria Garrick Browne, a mental health advocate who has been outspoken about her battle with a binge eating disorder, shared a similar sentiment during a recent episode of her ""Real Pod"" podcast. ""The Ozempic craze has been really hard for me because when I was younger, all I wanted was a magic pill that would make me lose 30 pounds,"" she shared. ""I remember Googling, 'How do I lose 30 pounds in a month?' And it feels like now we have that. It's this drug that you inject and you lose all this weight. I feel like I'm seeing it in celebrities, in everyday life ... This thing we all thought was impossible for weight loss is now a real thing."" Even if someone has gone through a healing process with body image or their relationship with food, these challenges can ""last a lifetime,"" said Alyssa Mairanz, a licensed mental health counselor and owner of Empower Your Mind Therapy. ""Sometimes you find a healthy relationship, and in your adulthood, you can be re-triggered by so many factors,"" said Mairanz. ""Many people find themselves re-triggered at different phases in adulthood."" Young said seeing ads for the drugs that promote ""suppressing your appetite"" and ""reducing cravings"" has also been hard. ""It really brought stuff up for me that completely contradicted my values around food these days,"" she said. Mairanz said this type of messaging can add to the ""culture of weight loss and body image as a whole and how our body looks versus how healthy our bodies actually are."" For anyone struggling with similar messaging, Mairanz urged people not to ""connect your self-worth to what your body looks like."" ""This can lead to frustration and potentially engaging in other damaging forms of weight loss,"" she said, adding to seek professional help if needed.

More than 2,300 adults responded to the survey, which was conducted by researchers from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and published on Friday. Thirty-two percent of responders said someone they knew died of a fatal drug overdose. For 18.9% of respondents, the person they knew who died ""was a family member or close friend."" The past few years have seen more than 100,000 people die of drug overdoses annually, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Over 1 million people in the United States have died of drug overdoses since 1990. The majority of those deaths have been opioid-related, according to the CDC, particularly driven by synthetic opioids like fentanyl. The survey showed that while people across the political spectrum had similar rates of loss, they were more likely to see addiction as an ""extremely or very important policy issue"" if they knew someone who had died from an overdose. Researchers said this shows that people who have lost loved ones to overdoses may be able to band together to ""facilitate greater policy change."" ""The drug overdose crisis is a national tragedy,"" said Alene Kennedy-Hendricks, who led the analysis, in a news release announcing the findings. ""Although large numbers of U.S. adults are bereaved due to overdose, they may not be as visible as other groups who have lost loved ones to less stigmatized health issues. Movements to build support for policy change to overcome the devastating toll of the overdose crisis should consider the role of this community."" A recent study by the National Institute on Drug Abuse found that more than 321,000 children in the United States have had parents die from overdoses in just the past decade. Economic costs associated with the opioid crisis are estimated to exceed $1 trillion annually in the United States, according to the survey. Kerry Breen is a news editor at CBSNews.com.

U.S. to make millions of bird flu vaccine doses this summer,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bird-flu-vaccine-doses-this-summer-cases/,The U.S. has ordered 4.8 million doses of vaccine to target bird flu in case the outbreak spreads in people.,"Some 4.8 million doses of flu vaccine are now being prepared for use in response to the growing U.S. outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza, or H5N1, officials say. The order for the doses to be filled into vials comes as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is investigating a growing number of human cases linked to the unprecedented outbreak of the virus in dairy cattle this year. The supplies will be pulled from a ""pre-pandemic"" stockpile funded by the federal Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response. Vaccinemaker CSL Seqirus has been tasked with manufacturing the doses at its North Carolina plant. ""It utilizes a highly scalable method of production and is currently positioned to deliver up to 150 million influenza vaccine doses to support an influenza pandemic response within six months of a pandemic declaration,"" CSL Seqirus said in a release. The doses combine bulk stockpiles of two key ingredients: an ""antigen"" targeted at the H5 portion of the H5N1 virus with an ""adjuvant"" designed to boost the immune response triggered by the vaccine. While manufacturing of these new bird flu doses is set to be completed by ""later this summer,"" the vaccines still may not be immediately ready for use. ""I do want to decouple availability and manufacturing completion, because there is of course that regulatory component that would be needed to either approve or authorize actual use of the doses,"" ASPR's David Boucher told reporters Thursday. The FDA has previously approved other vaccines to prepare for potential H5N1 pandemics, including a vaccine by Seqirus. It is unclear how soon the FDA could grant authorization to clear use of the new shots. ""While CDC's current risk assessment to the general public is low, if it is determined that the U.S. population needs to be vaccinated to prevent H5N1 influenza, then the FDA will use its regulatory pathways to take the appropriate steps to ensure vaccines are available in the timeliest manner possible,"" an FDA spokesperson said in a statement. Boucher also said that authorities have so far not decided whether to recommend use of the vaccines. It is unclear who would be prioritized for the first shots if they are eventually deemed to be needed and rolled out for the public. ""If that changes in the future, we would be looking at the population for whom vaccination would be recommended and then making any decisions on prioritization at that time,"" said Boucher. A panel of the CDC's outside vaccine advisers, which has discussed previous pandemic vaccines, is scheduled to meet in June to discuss H5N1 alongside its routine votes on recommendations for seasonal flu vaccines. While the CDC says the risk to the general public from H5N1 remains low for now, the agency has warned that workers in places like dairy farms and production facilities are now at higher risk of infection and it has urged the industry to take precautions. At least three workers at U.S. dairy farms have tested positive this year after working directly with infected cows. The latest case in Michigan developed respiratory symptoms, officials announced Thursday, which could make it easier for the virus to spread from person to person. ""Simply put, someone who's coughing may be more likely to transmit the virus than someone who has an eye infection like conjunctivitis,"" the CDC's Nirav Shah said Thursday. However, Shah said there is no evidence that person-to-person spread has happened so far. Contacts of the patient have so far not tested positive. Previous H5N1 spillovers around the world from different strains have also fizzled out after limited spread between people. The CDC is now looking to see if the strain that infected the latest Michigan patient might have developed key mutations that could raise its risk of spread. ""The mere fact that this individual displayed some respiratory symptoms, again we should be alert, but in and of itself is not a cause to change course or suggest that we're at an inflection point,"" Shah said.

The FDA is weighing approval of MDMA for PTSD. Here's what patients could see.,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-fda-is-weighing-whether-to-approve-mdma-for-ptsd-heres-what-that-could-look-like-for-patients/,Details of the FDA's proposal were published Friday ahead of a meeting next week.,"Ahead of a key meeting Tuesday to weigh the potential approval of midomafetamine, or MDMA, for patients with post-traumatic stress disorder, the Food and Drug Administration is proposing a new set of restrictions on how eligible patients would be able to get the drug. Details of the FDA's proposal were published Friday in a set of documents released by the agency ahead of an advisory committee meeting next week. After the panel votes, drugmaker Lykos Therapeutics says the FDA is expected to make a decision by Aug. 11 on whether to approve its approach for patients with PTSD: a four-month course of MDMA combined with psychotherapy. Among the FDA's questions for the committee is whether the benefits of MDMA, combined with the FDA's proposed restrictions on prescriptions for the hallucinogenic drug, will be enough to outweigh its risks. ""Patient impairment is an expected effect from midomafetamine administration and there must be safeguards to mitigate serious harm from patient impairment, similar to the risk mitigation in the clinical trials, to support patient safety,"" the FDA's reviewers said in a briefing document ahead of the meeting. Under the proposal, administering MDMA would be restricted to healthcare facilities that agree to ensure at least two providers are onsite to monitor patients while taking the drug. Patients will need to be monitored for at least eight hours, until they are psychologically stable enough to be discharged to an adult after the session. During the trials, many ended up staying overnight at study sites, being monitored by therapists. Providers will also need to prepare for some physical risks. In the trials, one participant was hospitalized after MDMA was suspected to have exacerbated a pre-existing heart problem. Patients will also need to be enrolled in a registry tracking side effects and issues that come up from the sessions, as well as how they are faring following completion of the treatment. ""We are also concerned about worsening of psychological disorders that cause disability or that may lead to hospitalization or death, and suicidal behaviors and ideation,"" the FDA said. The drugmaker has also been in talks with the FDA over other steps to curb risks of the drug, like providing the product in only single dose packages aimed at limiting the risk of ""nonmedical use,"" Lykos said in their briefing document. The FDA often turns to its authority to apply additional restrictions on prescription drugs, dubbed Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies or REMS, to curb the pitfalls of drugs that it thinks would otherwise be too dangerous to approve. Nasal sprays of hallucinogen esketamine to treat depression, branded as Spravato, were also approved in 2019 under these kinds of REMS restrictions. Additional restrictions could be imposed by a different agency – the Drug Enforcement Administration – which will be responsible for ""rescheduling"" the drug. The DEA currently deems MDMA or ""ecstasy"" to be a Schedule I drug, alongside other substances like heroin which the DEA says have ""no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.""

"Mediterranean diet associated with 23% reduction in mortality, study finds",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mediterranean-diet-reduces-mortality-study/,"The Mediterranean diet has long been regarded as a heart-healthy option, but a new study has found the diet may help reduce risk of death.","The Mediterranean diet has long been regarded as a heart-healthy option, but a new study has found the diet may help lower the risk of death. For the study, published in JAMA Network Open Friday, researchers examined 25,315 women over 25 years, finding a higher adherence to the diet was associated with a 23% reduced risk of all-cause mortality. Decreased risks of cardiovascular disease and cancer mortality were also noted. A Mediterranean diet, patterned on the traditional cuisines of the region, emphasizes fresh fruits and vegetables, fish, legumes, nuts and whole grains. Researchers collected baseline health information from the participants between 1993 and 1996, which included data on 33 blood biomarkers, self-reported weight, lifestyle and more. The participants, who were all female health care professionals with a mean age of 54.6, then completed health questionnaires every six months during the first year and then annually. Data analysis occurred from 2018 to 2023, using medical and death records to determine mortality and cause of death. ""Participants with higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet generally exhibited healthier lifestyles, including lower BMI and higher intake of fruits, nuts, whole grains, legumes, and fish, while consuming less red and processed meat,"" the authors note. ""A higher Mediterranean diet score was associated with an overall healthier biomarker profile."" This isn't the first time research has pointed to the diet as a healthy way of eating. A study last year found the diet could help reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in women by 24%, though it was a meta-analysis of that looked at 16 prior studies. The latest study did have some limitations, however, including a lack of racial and ethnic diversity. Participants were middle aged and older, well-educated females who were predominantly (just over 94%) self-reported as white. This may limit the generalizability of the findings, the authors note. Dietary adherence was also assessed through food questionnaires, which could have contained misclassifications. Sara Moniuszko is a health and lifestyle reporter at CBSNews.com.

Mexico votes in election likely to choose country's first female president,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mexico-presidential-election-female-leader-voting/,Nearly 100 million people are registered to vote in the race to replace outgoing President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.,"Polls are closed as Mexicans voted in an election likely to bring about the first female president in the country's history on Sunday, in a matchup between a former academic who promises to further the current leader's populist policies and an ex-senator and tech entrepreneur who pledges to up the fight against deadly drug cartels. Nearly 100 million people are registered to vote in the race to replace outgoing President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. Voters will also elect governors in nine of the country's 32 states, and choose candidates for both houses of Congress, thousands of mayorships and other local posts, in the biggest elections the nation has seen and ones that have been marked by violence. The elections are widely seen as a referendum on López Obrador, a populist who has expanded social programs but largely failed to reduce cartel violence in Mexico. His Morena party currently holds 23 of the 32 governorships and a simple majority of seats in both houses of Congress. Mexico's constitution prohibits the president's reelection. Morena hopes to gain the two-thirds majority in Congress required to amend the constitution to eliminate oversight agencies that it says are unwieldy and wasteful. The opposition, running in a loose coalition, argues that would endanger Mexico's democratic institutions. Both major presidential candidates are women, and either would be Mexico's first female president. A third candidate from a smaller party, Jorge Álvarez Máynez, trails far behind. Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum is running with the Morena party. Sheinbaum, who leads in the race, has promised to continue all of López Obrador's policies, including a universal pension for the elderly and a program that pays youths to apprentice. Opposition presidential candidate Xóchitl Gálvez, whose father was Indigenous Otomi, rose from selling snacks on the street in her poor hometown to start her own tech firms. A candidate running with a coalition of major opposition parties, she left the Senate last year to focus her ire on López Obrador's decision to avoid confronting the drug cartels through his ""hugs not bullets"" policy. She has pledged to more aggressively go after criminals. The persistent cartel violence, along with Mexico's middling economic performance, are the main issues on voters' minds. The Mexican peso has strengthened against the U.S. dollar in recent years, mainly because of high domestic interest rates and a huge surge in money sent home by migrants. But the gross domestic product has averaged only about 1% growth per year under the current president. López Obrador claims to have reduced historically high homicide levels by 20% since he took office in December 2018. But that's largely a claim based on a questionable reading of statistics; the real homicide rate appears to have declined by only about 4% in six years. About 675,000 Mexicans living abroad are registered to vote, but in the past only a small percentage have done so. Voting is not mandatory in Mexico, and overall turnout has hovered around 60% in recent elections. That compares to turnout in recent U.S. presidential elections. An exception was in 2020, when the matchup between then-President Donald Trump and future President Joe Biden pushed U.S. voter turnout to 67%, its highest point in decades. Just as the upcoming November rematch between Biden and Trump has underscored deep divisions in the U.S., Sunday's election has revealed how severely polarized public opinion is in Mexico over the direction of the country, including its security strategy and how to grow the economy. Beyond the fight for control of Congress, the race for Mexico City — whose top post is now considered equivalent to a governorship — is also important. Sheinbaum is just the latest of many Mexico City mayors, including López Obrador, who went on to run for president. Governorships in large, populous states such as Veracruz and Jalisco are also drawing interest. Polls opened at 8 a.m. and close at 6 p.m. (0000 GMT Monday) in most of the country. The first preliminary, partial results are expected by 9 p.m. (0300 GMT Monday) after the last polls in different time zones close. ",CBSnews,US
Parachute jump kicks off commemorations for the 80th anniversary of D-Day,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/d-day-80th-anniversary-parachute-jump-wwii-era-planes-commemorations/,"Three C-47 transport planes, a workhorse of World War II, dropped three long strings of jumpers, their round chutes mushrooming open in the blue skies with puffy white clouds.","Parachutists hurled themselves from World War II-era planes into the now peaceful Normandy skies where war once raged, kicking off a week of ceremonies to mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day. On Sunday, three C-47 transport planes, a workhorse of the war, dropped three long strings of jumpers, their round chutes mushrooming open in the blue skies with puffy white clouds, to whoops from the huge crown that was regaled by tines from Glenn Miller and Edith Piaf as they waited. The planes looped around and dropped another three sticks of jumpers. Some of the loudest applause from the crowd arose when a startled deer pounced from the undergrowth as the jumpers were landing and sprinted across the landing zone. After a final pass to drop two last jumpers, the planes then roared overhead in close formation and disappeared over the horizon. A week of ceremonies is planned for the fast-disappearing generation of Allied troops who fought from D-Day beaches 80 years ago to Adolf Hitler's fall, freeing Europe of his tyranny. All along the Normandy coastline – where then-young soldiers from across the United States, Britain, Canada, and other Allied nations waded ashore through hails of fire on five beaches on June 6, 1944 – French officials, grateful Normandy survivors, and other admirers are saying ""merci"" but also goodbye. The ever-dwindling number of veterans in their late nineties and older who are coming back to remember fallen friends and their history-changing exploits are the last. Dozens of World War II veterans are converging on France, many perhaps for the last time, to revisit old memories, make new ones, and hammer home a message that survivors of D-Day and the ensuing Battle of Normandy, and of other World War II theaters, have repeated time and time again — that war is hell. ""Seven thousand of my marine buddies were killed. Twenty thousand shot up, wounded, put on ships, buried at sea,"" said Don Graves, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran who served in Iwo Jima in the Pacific theater. ""I want the younger people, the younger generation here to know what we did,"" said Graves, part of a group of more than 60 World War II veterans who flew into Paris on Saturday. The youngest veteran in the group is 96 and the most senior 107, according to their carrier from Dallas, American Airlines. ""We did our job and we came home and that's it. We never talked about it I think. For 70 years I didn't talk about it,"" said another of the veterans, Ralph Goldsticker, a U.S. Air Force captain who served in the 452nd Bomb Group. Of the D-Day landings, he recalled seeing from his aircraft ""a big, big chunk of the beach with thousands of vessels"" and spoke of bombing raids against German strongholds and routes that German forces might otherwise have used to rush in reinforcements to push the invasion back into the sea. ""I dropped my first bomb at 06:58 a.m. in a heavy gun placement,"" he said. ""We went back home, we landed at 09:30. We reloaded."" Part of the purpose of fireworks shows, parachute jumps, solemn commemorations and ceremonies that world leaders will attend this week is to pass the baton of remembrance to the current generations now seeing war again in Europe, in Ukraine. U.S. President Biden, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and British royals are among the VIPs that France is expecting for the D-Day events. ",CBSnews,US
South Korea pledges retaliation against North over trash-filled balloons,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/south-korea-retaliate-north-korea-garbage-filled-balloons-border/,South Korea says it'll take strong retaliatory steps against North Korea over its launch of trash-carrying balloons across the border and other provocations.,"South Korea said Sunday it'll soon take ""unbearable"" retaliatory steps against North Korea over its launch of trash-carrying balloons across the border and other provocations. In the past week, North Korea floated hundreds of huge balloons to dump rubbish on South Korea, simulated nuclear strikes against its neighbor and allegedly jammed GPS navigation signals in the South in an escalation of animosities between the rivals. South Korea's national security director Chang Ho-jin said Sunday that top officials at an emergency meeting decided to take ""unbearable"" measures against North Korea in response to its recent series of provocative acts. Chang called the North's balloon campaign and its alleged GPS signal jamming ""absurd, irrational acts of provocation that a normal country can't imagine."" He accused North Korea of aiming to cause ""public anxieties and chaos"" in South Korea. South Korean officials didn't say what retaliatory steps they would take. But many observers say South Korea will likely resume front-line loudspeaker broadcasts into North Korea that include criticism of its abysmal human rights situation, world news and K-pop songs. North Korea is extremely sensitive to such broadcasts because most of its 26 million people have no official access to foreign TV and radio programs. Earlier Sunday, South Korea's military said that more than 700 balloons flown from North Korea were additionally discovered in various parts of South Korea. Tied to the balloons were cigarette butts, scraps of cloth, waste paper and vinyl, but no dangerous substances, according to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It was North Korea's second balloon activity in less than a week. Between Tuesday and Wednesday, South Korean officials said they had found about 260 North Korean balloons carrying trash and manure. There have been no reports of major damage in South Korea. North Korea said its balloon floating was in reaction to South Korean activists flying anti-Pyongyang propaganda leaflets via their own balloons across the border. North Korea often responds with fury to balloons from South Korea. In 2020, North Korea exploded an empty, South Korean-built liaison office in the North in anger over the South Korean balloon activities. Experts say North Korea's balloon campaign, reportedly the first of its kind in seven years, is meant to stoke an internal divide in South Korea over its conservative government's tough policy on the North. They say North Korea is also expected to further ramp up tensions ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November. Since 2022, North Korea has sharply increased a pace of weapons tests to build a bigger nuclear arsenal. Last week, it fired a barrage of nuclear-capable weapons into the sea in a drill simulating a preemptive attack on South Korea. ",CBSnews,US
Chinese spacecraft lands on far side of moon,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chinese-spacecraft-lands-on-moon/,"The spacecraft, part of the Chang'e moon exploration program, will collect soil and rock samples.","Just hours after NASA was forced to scrap the Florida launch of the Boeing Starliner for the second time, a Chinese spacecraft landed on the far side of the moon Sunday to collect soil and rock samples that could provide insights into differences between the less-explored region and the better-known near side. The landing module touched down at 6:23 a.m. Beijing time in a huge crater known as the South Pole-Aitken Basin, the China National Space Administration said. The mission is the sixth in the Chang'e moon exploration program, which is named after a Chinese moon goddess. It is the second designed to bring back samples, following the Chang'e 5, which did so from the near side in 2020. The moon program is part of a growing rivalry with the U.S. — still the leader in space exploration — and others, including Japan and India. China has put its own space station in orbit and regularly sends crews there. The emerging global power aims to put a person on the moon before 2030, which would make it the second nation after the United States to do so. America is planning to land astronauts on the moon again — for the first time in more than 50 years — though NASA pushed the target date back to 2026 earlier this year. U.S. efforts to use private sector rockets to launch spacecraft have been repeatedly delayed. Last-minute computer trouble nixed the planned maiden launch of Boeing's first astronaut flight Saturday from Cape Canaveral. The Boeing Starliner, carrying two astronauts bound for the International Space Station, was less than four minutes from takeoff when a computer system triggered an automatic hold. NASA initially said it would attempt another launch Sunday, before delaying the potential launch until at least Wednesday. Last month, trouble with a pressure relief valve in the Starliner's Atlas 5 rocket, along a helium leak in the capsule's propulsion module, scrubbed a May 6 launch attempt. The first piloted flight of the Starliner is Boeing's answer to SpaceX's Crew Dragon, an already operational, less expensive spacecraft that has carried 50 astronauts, cosmonauts and civilians into orbit in 13 flights, 12 of them to the space station, since an initial piloted test flight in May 2020. Earlier Saturday, a Japanese billionaire called off his plan to orbit the moon because of uncertainty over the development of a mega rocket by SpaceX. NASA is planning to use the rocket to send its astronauts to the moon. In China's current mission, the lander is to use a mechanical arm and a drill to gather up to 4.4 pounds of surface and underground material for about two days. An ascender atop the lander will then take the samples in a metal vacuum container back to another module that is orbiting the moon. The container will be transferred to a re-entry capsule that is due to return to Earth in the deserts of China's Inner Mongolia region about June 25. Missions to the moon's far side are more difficult because it doesn't face the Earth, requiring a relay satellite to maintain communications. The terrain is also more rugged, with fewer flat areas to land. ",CBSnews,US

"How James Patterson completed Michael Crichton's ""Eruption""",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-james-patterson-completed-michael-crichtons-eruption/,"When the ""Jurassic Park"" writer died in 2008, he left behind an unfinished novel about a volcanic eruption that imperils all life on Earth. Enter bestselling author James Patterson, tasked with completing Crichton's thriller.","If you ever want to feel a sense of awe, try standing near an erupting volcano. The late author Michael Crichton was fascinated with volcanoes for most of his life. And even now, 16 years after his death, among the countless books and papers at his office in Santa Monica you'll find stacks of volcano research. For his widow, Sherri Alexander Crichton, it's almost as if he's still here. ""I feel his energy around all the time,"" she said. And in the mountain of papers he left behind, she found parts of an unfinished novel centered around a huge volcanic eruption. It struck Sherri as something he would've wanted to share – a posthumous blockbuster from someone who, in his relatively short life, gave the world so much, including genetically-recreated dinosaurs. In the literary world, Michael Crichton was a colossus – the only writer to have a number one book, movie, and TV show in the same year. He was also a Harvard-educated doctor, a prolific genius who created scientific thrillers that brought millions along on heart-pounding rides, from big city emergency rooms in ""ER,"" to the tornado-ravaged heartland in ""Twister,"" to places that exist only in our dreams (and nightmares), like ""Jurassic Park."" Sherri Crichton remembers him as someone who was incredibly fun, but at times distant. ""I remember when I first started dating Michael, a very dear friend of mine said, 'Sherri, it's gonna go like this: It's gonna feel like he doesn't wanna have anything to do with you when he's writing. It's not gonna feel like he loves you anymore because he's gonna be into the book. And you're gonna have to be okay with that.' And I was like, 'Of course, of course I'll be OK.' ""But when it hit, like those first few times when he would really separate, he was present, but he actually was still in his creation, whatever that was,"" she said. She admits it was a hard time: ""And it took a lot of self-confidence to be able to say to myself, 'This is gonna be okay. Let's give it another month. Let's see what it's gonna be like.'"" They married in 2005, but three years later, Michael Crichton died of cancer at age 66, leaving Sherri alone, and six months pregnant with their son, John Michael. As she picked up the pieces of her life, she discovered and read parts of the volcano book he'd been working on, a page-turner about a massive eruption in Hawaii worse than any in history. It ended abruptly. ""But I kept thinking, 'There has to be more,'"" Sherri said. And so, after more than a decade, she decided it was time to finish it. But then there was the question of who. ""I just went big. I thought, 'What about James Patterson?'"" James Patterson is one of the most successful authors in history, who has sold around 400 million books, and collaborated with people like President Bill Clinton and Dolly Parton. Truth is, Patterson has a backlog of projects that keep him working every day. But when Sherri Crichton called, he answered. And Michael Crichton's story – about the explosive volcano and the fact that it threatened to crack open a stockpile of toxic waste so potent that it could destroy life on planet Earth – was too good for him to pass up. But finishing the book was a tall order for both Patterson and Sherri Crichton. She said she was apprehensive at first: ""I was just nervous because it's a new relationship,"" Sherri said.

He said, ""I had read everything that Michael Crichton wrote. So, I think had a sense of the voice. This book might be a little pacier than some of his books, just a little bit. But I had a feeling for it. I challenge people, for them to come out and say, This is where Michael stopped, and this is where James started. And I'm really proud of that. I'm really happy about it."" The end result – ""Eruption,"" by Michael Crichton and James Patterson – will be out tomorrow.

""And I felt with 'Eruption' and Michael Crichton, I thought I could do it beautifully,"" Patterson said.

"Google admits its AI Overviews can generate ""some odd, inaccurate"" results",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/google-ai-overview/,Google said it's rolling back its AI-generated search results feature after two weeks. Here's why.,"Google on Thursday admitted that its AI Overviews tool, which uses artificial intelligence to respond to search queries, needs improvement. While the internet search giant said it tested the new feature extensively before launching it two weeks ago, Google acknowledged that the technology produces ""some odd and erroneous overviews."" Examples include suggesting using glue to get cheese to stick to pizza or drinking urine to pass kidney stones quickly. While many of the examples were minor, others search results were potentially dangerous. Asked by the Associated Press last week which wild mushrooms were edible, Google provided a lengthy AI-generated summary that was mostly technically correct. But ""a lot of information is missing that could have the potential to be sickening or even fatal,"" said Mary Catherine Aime, a professor of mycology and botany at Purdue University who reviewed Google's response to the AP's query. For example, information about mushrooms known as puffballs was ""more or less correct,"" she said, but Google's overview emphasized looking for those with solid white flesh - which many potentially deadly puffball mimics also have. In another widely shared example, an AI researcher asked Google how many Muslims have been president of the U.S., and it responded confidently with a long-debunked conspiracy theory: ""The United States has had one Muslim president, Barack Hussein Obama."" The rollback is the latest instance of a tech company prematurely rushing out an AI product to position itself as a leader in the closely watched space. Because Google's AI Overviews sometimes generated unhelpful responses to queries, the company is scaling it back while continuing to make improvements, Google's head of search, Liz Reid, said in a company blog post Thursday. ""[S]ome odd, inaccurate or unhelpful AI Overviews certainly did show up. And while these were generally for queries that people don't commonly do, it highlighted some specific areas that we needed to improve,"" Reid said. Nonsensical questions such as, ""How many rocks should I eat?"" generated questionable content from AI Overviews, Reid said, because of the lack of useful, related advice on the internet. She added that the AI Overviews feature is also prone to taking sarcastic content from discussion forums at face value, and potentially misinterpreting webpage language to present inaccurate information in response to Google searches. ""In a small number of cases, we have seen AI Overviews misinterpret language on webpages and present inaccurate information. We worked quickly to address these issues, either through improvements to our algorithms or through established processes to remove responses that don't comply with our policies,"" Reid wrote. For now, the company is scaling back on AI-generated overviews by adding ""triggering restrictions for queries where AI Overviews were not proving to be as helpful."" Google also says it tries not to show AI Overviews for hard news topics ""where freshness and factuality are important."" The company said it has also made updates ""to limit the use of user-generated content in responses that could offer misleading advice."" —The Associated Press contributed to this report.

British journalist Adam Higginbotham, author of ""Midnight in Chernobyl: The Untold Story of the World's Greatest Nuclear Disaster,"" returns with his exhaustively-researched new book, ""Challenger: A True Story of Heroism and Disaster on the Edge of Space"" (Simon & Schuster), about the 1986 space shuttle disaster. Read an excerpt below. ""Challenger"" by Adam Higginbotham Prefer to listen? Audible has a 30-day free trial available right now. Flight Control Room OneJohnson Space Center, HoustonJanuary 28, 1986, 8:30 a.m. The coffee, as usual, was terrible: bitter and thin, the color of tea; almost certainly undrinkable. He filled a cup anyway, returned to his console, and plugged in his headset. It promised to be a long morning. Steve Nesbitt had arrived at his office early, checking for the latest weather updates from the Cape before taking the short walk, out past the duck ponds to Building 30, and up in the elevator to Mission Control. But from what he'd already seen on TV, there was no way they would launch today: it was freezing down in Florida, and there were two-foot icicles hanging from the gantry. Space Shuttle mission 51-L seemed sure to face yet another delay. Nesbitt had been with NASA public affairs for just over five years, and was there for the triumph of the first Space Shuttle launch in 1981 — helping to respond to a clamor of press and media inquiries from all over the world. Since then, he had become chief commentator for Mission Control, and delivered the live commentary from Houston on almost every one of the twenty-four shuttle flights. But he was still nervous. Responsibility for translating the bewildering patois of engineering jargon and acronyms spoken by NASA engineers and astronauts into language the public could understand began with the launch countdown commentary that boomed from the loudspeakers at Cape Canaveral. After that — once the count reached zero and the spacecraft left the ground — everything that happened was on Nesbitt's watch. There was no script, and he knew his words went out live to anyone watching a launch on television — either on the three national networks, on the recently launched cable channel CNN, or over NASA's own dedicated satellite feed; he relied instead on his Ascent Events List, which mapped a series of milestones the shuttle would pass on its way to orbit, from the slow roll it would execute as it roared away from the launchpad to the moment its main engines cut out, at the edge of space. The hushed environment of the Flight Control Rooms had been devised to concentrate the minds of each of the flight controllers on their own tasks, and only recently had a TV set been installed near the Flight Director's console, to display images of the shuttle in flight. Nesbitt rarely had time to look at that, as he focused attention on the console in front of him. Here, he had access to real-time information about the spacecraft: on his headset, he could listen in to dozens of audio ""loops"" connecting groups of NASA engineers and flight controllers on the internal communications network; and on a pair of black-and-white monitors, he could see telemetry data transmitted back to Earth from the shuttle, columns of numbers updated every second describing any one of hundreds of technical parameters of its performance in flight. With a couple of hundred feeds to choose from, Nesbitt had his regular preferences: ""Flight Ops Procedures,"" which included data on the shuttle's engine performance, and the ""Trajectory"" display, which showed its speed, altitude, and downrange distance. Even with all this at his fingertips, Nesbitt found the live commentary nerve-racking, and practiced often. He took his duty of public service seriously, and hated it when other commentators took flight with flowery language, like Hollywood PR guys. He wanted to play it straight. And yet, suffering from the effects of a cold he'd picked up the day before, even as the final countdown began, Nesbitt would have welcomed another launch delay: his throat was sore, and he wasn't certain he could talk through the whole ascent without his voice straining or cracking. He waited in silence for his cue: for the shuttle engines and the giant solid rockets to light; for his counterpart at the Cape to announce that Challenger had cleared the tower. It was almost exactly 11:38 in the morning when Nesbitt saw the numbers on his screen start to move, and a few seconds later keyed his mike to speak: ""Good roll program confirmed. Challenger now heading downrange."" At the console position next to him, the flight surgeon — a navy doctor in full uniform — had her eyes on the big TV set across the room. It was a perfect launch. Challenger was less than half a minute into flight when Nesbitt gave his next update. ""Engines beginning throttling down, now at 94 percent,"" he said. ""Normal throttle for most of the flight is 104 percent. We'll throttle down to 65 percent shortly."" The flight surgeon watched the shuttle climb higher into the cloudless sky over the Atlantic; Nesbitt kept his gaze on the monitors. ""Velocity 2,257 feet per second,"" he said. ""Altitude 4.3 nautical miles, downrange distance three nautical miles."" The numbers all looked good; at sixty-eight seconds, he reported the next key moment on the list in front of him. ""Engines are throttling up. Three engines now at 104 percent."" Ten feet away, down on the next row of consoles, astronaut Dick Covey confirmed the change with the shuttle commander: ""Challenger, go at throttle up."" ""Roger, go at throttle up."" The spacecraft was one minute and ten seconds into flight. Four seconds later, Nesbitt heard a loud crackle in his headphones. Beside him, the surgeon saw Challenger abruptly obscured by a ball of orange and white flame. ""What was that?"" she said. But Nesbitt was staring at his monitors. ""One minute fifteen seconds. Velocity 2,900 feet per second,"" he said. ""Altitude nine nautical miles. Downrange distance seven nautical miles."" Then Nesbitt looked up, and followed the surgeon's gaze toward the TV set. Something terrible had happened. There was no sign of Challenger, just the expanding fireball where it had once been — and the exhaust trails of the shuttle's two booster rockets, twisting in opposite directions across the sky. His console was no help: the data streams had frozen. Around him, the other flight controllers sat stunned, faces slack with shock. No one said a word. Nesbitt knew he had to speak, but he had no information to explain what he was witnessing. His mind raced. He thought of his responsibility to the public, and to the astronauts' families. He thought, suddenly, of the attempt on Ronald Reagan's life nearly five years before: in the confusion that followed, CBS news anchor Dan Rather had announced that White House press secretary James Brady had been killed — only to discover that Brady, despite the bullet in his head, remained very much alive. Nesbitt didn't want to make a mistake like that. A few moments of quiet extended into half a minute. An agonizing silence enveloped the NASA commentary loop; an eternity of dead air. On the TV screen, the cloud drifted in the wind; fragments of debris fluttered toward the ocean. The Flight Director polled his team in vain for answers. It was forty-one seconds before Steve Nesbitt spoke again. ""Flight controllers here looking very carefully at the situation,"" he said, his voice flat and impassive. ""Obviously a major malfunction."" Excerpted from ""Challenger: A True Story of Heroism and Disaster on the Edge of Space"" by Adam Higginbotham. Published by Avid Reader Press/Simon and Schuster.

Tiny fern breaks world record for largest genome on Earth,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tiny-fern-world-record-largest-genome-tmesipteris-oblanceolata/,"The New Caledonian fern, Tmesipteris oblanceolata, has more than 50 times more DNA packed into the nucleus of its cells than humans do.","A small, seemingly unremarkable fern that only grows on a remote Pacific island was on Friday crowned the Guinness World Record holder for having the largest genome of any organism on Earth. The New Caledonian fern, Tmesipteris oblanceolata, has more than 50 times more DNA packed into the nucleus of its cells than humans do. If the DNA from one of the fern's cells — which are just a fraction of a millimeter wide — were unraveled, it would stretch out to 350 feet, scientists said in a new study. Stood upright, the DNA would be taller than the Statue of Liberty and the tower that holds London's famous Big Ben bell. The fern's genome weighed in at a whopping 160 gigabase pairs (Gbp), the measurement for DNA length. That is 7% larger than the previous record holder, the Japanese flowering plant Paris japonica. The human genome is a relatively puny 3.1 Gbp. If our DNA were unraveled, it would be around six feet long. Study co-author Ilia Leitch, a researcher at the UK's Royal Botanic Gardens Kew, told AFP that the team was ""really surprised to find something even bigger than Paris japonica"". ""We thought we'd already reached the biological limit. We're really pushing at the extremes of biology,"" she said. The fern, which grows five to 10 centimeters tall, is only found in New Caledonia, a French Pacific territory that has recently seen unrest. Two members of the research team traveled to the main island, Grand Terre, in 2023 and worked with local scientists for the study, which was published in the journal iScience. Guinness World Records awarded the fern its coveted ""largest genome title."" ""To think this innocuous-looking fern boasts 50 times more DNA than humans is a humbling reminder that there's still so much about the plant kingdom we don't know, and that record holders aren't always the showiest on the outside,"" Guinness World Records managing editor Adam Millward said, according to the BBC. Humans are estimated to have more than 30 trillion cells in our bodies. Within each of those cells is a nucleus that contains DNA, which is like a ""book of instructions that tells an organism like ourselves how to live and survive"", Leitch explained. All of an organism's DNA is called its genome. So far, scientists have estimated the genome size of around 20,000 organisms, just a fraction of life on Earth. In the animal kingdom, some of the largest genomes include certain lungfishes and salamanders at about 120 billion base pairs, according to the BBC. While plants have the biggest genomes, they can also have incredibly small ones. The carnivorous Genlisea aurea's genome is just 0.06 Gbp. But we humans need not feel inadequate when comparing ourselves to the mighty T. oblanceolata. All the evidence suggests that having a huge genome is a disadvantage, Leitch said. The more DNA you have, the larger your cells need to be to squeeze it all in. For plants, bigger cells mean things like the pores of leaves have to be larger, which can make them grow more slowly. It is also trickier to make new copies of all that DNA, limiting their reproductive abilities. This means the most massive genomes are seen in slow-growing, perennial plants which cannot easily adapt to adversity or contend with competition. Genome size can therefore affect how plants respond to climate change, changing land use and other environmental challenges caused by humans, Leitch said. There could still be bigger genomes somewhere out there but Leitch thinks this fern must be near the limit. ""How does it function? How does it survive with that much DNA in it?"" Leitch told the BBC. Scientists do not know what most of the DNA does in such huge genomes, she admitted. Some say most of it is ""junk DNA"". ""But that's probably our own ignorance. Maybe it does have a function, and we have yet to find it,"" Leitch said. Jonathan Wendel, a botanist at Iowa State University not involved in the research, agreed it was ""astonishing"" how much DNA the fern is packing. But this only ""represents the first step,"" he told AFP. ""A great mystery is the meaning of all of this variation -- how do genomes grow and shrink, and what are the evolutionary causes and consequences of these phenomena?"" ",CBSnews,US
The bird flu vaccine is made with eggs. That has scientists worried.,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bird-flu-vaccine-chicken-eggs-researching-alternatives/,"The spread of an avian flu virus in cattle has again brought public health attention to the potential for a global pandemic. Fighting it would depend, for now, on 1940s technology that makes vaccines from hens' eggs.","Even a peep of news about a new flu pandemic is enough to set scientists clucking about eggs. They worried about them in 2005, and in 2009, and they're worrying now. That's because millions of fertilized hen eggs are still the main ingredient in making vaccines that, hopefully, will protect people against the outbreak of a new flu strain. ""It's almost comical to be using a 1940s technology for a 21st-century pandemic,"" said Rick Bright, who led the Health and Human Services Department's Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority during the Trump administration. It's not so funny, he said, when the currently stockpiled formulation against the H5N1 bird flu virus requires two shots and a whopping 90 micrograms of antigen, yet provides just middling immunity. ""For the U.S. alone, it would take hens laying 900,000 eggs every single day for nine months,"" Bright said. And that's only if the chickens don't get infected. The spread of an avian flu virus has decimated flocks of birds (and killed barn cats and other mammals). Cattle in at least nine states and at least two people in the U.S. have been infected, enough to bring public health attention once again to the potential for a global pandemic. So far, the only confirmed human cases of infection were dairy workers in Texas and Michigan, both of whom suffered pink eye and quickly recovered. Yet the virus's spread into multiple species over a vast geographic area raises the threat that further mutations could create a virus that spreads from human to human through airborne transmission, causing respiratory infections. If they do, prevention starts with the egg. To make raw material for an influenza vaccine, virus is grown in millions of fertilized eggs. Sometimes it doesn't grow well, or it mutates to a degree that the vaccine product stimulates antibodies that don't neutralize the virus — or the wild virus mutates to an extent that the vaccine doesn't work against it. And there's always the frightening prospect that wild birds could carry the virus into the henhouses needed in vaccine production. ""Once those roosters and hens go down, you have no vaccine,"" Bright said. Since 2009, when an H1N1 swine flu pandemic swept around the world before vaccine production could get off the ground, researchers and governments have been looking for alternatives. Billions of dollars have been invested into vaccines produced in mammalian and insect cell lines that don't pose the same risks as egg-based shots. ""Everyone knows the cell-based vaccines are better, more immunogenic, and offer better production,"" said Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease specialist at Johns Hopkins University's Center for Health Security. ""But they are handicapped because of the clout of egg-based manufacturing."" The companies that make the cell-based influenza vaccines, CSL Seqirus and Sanofi, also have billions invested in egg-based production lines that they aren't eager to replace. And it's hard to blame them, said Nicole Lurie, HHS' assistant secretary for preparedness and response under President Barack Obama who is now an executive director of CEPI, the global epidemic-fighting nonprofit. ""Most vaccine companies that responded to an epidemic — Ebola, Zika, COVID — ended up losing a lot of money on it,"" Lurie said. Exceptions were the mRNA vaccines created for COVID, although even Pfizer and Moderna have had to destroy hundreds of millions of doses of unwanted vaccine as public interest waned. Pfizer and Moderna are testing seasonal influenza vaccines made with mRNA, and the government is soliciting bids for mRNA pandemic flu vaccines, said David Boucher, director of infectious disease preparedness at HHS' Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response. Bright, whose agency invested a billion dollars in a cell-based flu vaccine factory in Holly Springs, North Carolina, said there's ""no way in hell we can fight an H5N1 pandemic with an egg-based vaccine."" But for now, there's little choice. BARDA has stockpiled hundreds of thousands of doses of an H5N1-strain vaccine that stimulates the creation of antibodies that appear to neutralize the virus now circulating. It could produce millions more doses of the vaccine within weeks and up to 100 million doses in five months, Boucher told KFF Health News. But the vaccines currently in the national stockpile are not a perfect match for the strain in question. Even with two shots containing six times as much vaccine substance as typical flu shots, the stockpiled vaccines were only partly effective against strains of the virus that circulated when those vaccines were made, Adalja said. However, BARDA is currently supporting two clinical trials with a candidate vaccine virus that ""is a good match for what we've found in cows,"" Boucher said. Flu vaccine makers are just starting to prepare this fall's shots but, eventually, the federal government could request production be switched to a pandemic-targeted strain. ""We don't have the capacity to do both,"" Adalja said. For now, ASPR has a stockpile of bulk pandemic vaccine and has identified manufacturing sites where 4.8 million doses could be bottled and finished without stopping production of seasonal flu vaccine, ASPR chief Dawn O'Connell said on May 22. U.S. officials began trying to diversify away from egg-based vaccines in 2005, when avian flu first gripped the world, and with added vigor after the 2009 fiasco. But ""with the resources we have available, we get the best bang for our buck and best value to U.S. taxpayers when we leverage the seasonal infrastructure, and that's still mostly egg-based,"" Boucher said. Flu vaccine companies ""have a system that works well right now to accomplish their objectives in manufacturing the seasonal vaccine,"" he said. And without a financial incentive, ""we are going to be here with eggs for a while, I think.""

Arizona tribe temporarily bans dances after police officer shot dead,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/arizona-tribe-bans-dances-police-officer-shot-gila-river-indian-community/,The Gila River Indian Community issued a temporary ban on dances after a police officer was fatally shot and another wounded while responding to a reported disturbance.,"The Gila River Indian Community has issued a temporary ban on dances after a tribal police officer was fatally shot and another wounded while responding to a reported disturbance at a Santan home, tribal officials said Sunday. Stephen Roe Lewis, governor of the tribe south of Phoenix, said a special meeting of community council's leaders was held Saturday night. The council approved a temporary moratorium on all permitted and non-permitted dances in the community, effective immediately, along with enhanced penalties for trespassing and disorderly conduct, he said. The Phoenix FBI and Gila River Police Department will conduct a joint investigation of the shooting, though many details have not yet been released. The Arizona Republic reported that the shooting occurred at a teenager's birthday party in Santan, located in one of the tribal community's seven districts. Joshua Briese, who had been with the Gila River Police Department for less than a year and had not completed field training, responded to the scene along with another tribal police officer around 2 a.m. Saturday on a 911 disturbance call involving a large crowd. Police said multiple gunshots were fired and both officers were struck, with four other people wounded. Briese was declared dead at a hospital, and the other officer, whose name hasn't been released yet, was listed in serious but stable condition, according to police. One of the four people wounded later died, police said. The names of the victims weren't immediately available Sunday. ""We extend our deepest condolences to his family, friends and colleagues,"" the FBI Phoenix said in a statement Saturday. ""Our hearts and prayers are with these police officers, their families, and everyone impacted by this tragic incident,"" Gila River police said. Briese, 23, was the son of a former sheriff's deputy in Montana who also died in the line of duty. The Yellowstone County Sheriff's Office said in a Facebook post that David Briese was killed in a November 2006 car crash. News reports said David Briese was responding at the time to a backup call for an officer who was dealing with a combative impaired driver in Billings, Montana. ",CBSnews,US
"Shooting in Ohio kills 1, wounds 2 dozen others, police say",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/akron-ohio-deadly-shooting/,"An early morning shooting in Akron, Ohio killed one person and injured two dozen people, some critically, police said.","An early morning shooting in Ohio killed one person and injured at least two dozen people, some critically, police said. Shots were reported at a street party in the city of Akron early Sunday just after midnight and multiple victims were hit by the gunfire, police said. Local hospitals told emergency dispatchers soon afterward that people were arriving in their emergency departments with gunshot wounds. One 27-year-old man was confirmed dead. At least two of the injured victims were in critical condition, Akron Police Chief Brian Harding said at a Sunday evening news conference. The victims ranged in age from 19 to 43, with the majority in their thirties. Officers were initially called to the area at 10 p.m. and broke up a crowd of over 200 people who had gathered for a birthday party, Harding said. The crowd gathered again after police left the area, Harding said, and officers returned around midnight when the gunfire was reported. Harding said the victims were spread out over a large area and the number of bullet casings indicated it was possible someone might have shot at the crowd from a moving car while others at the party may have returned fire. Two handguns were recovered at the scene, though the casings indicate other weapons were used as well. No arrests have been made and authorities urged the community to come forward with information about the suspects and the vehicle involved in the shooting. Harding said that over 100 people may have witnessed the incident, adding, ""They have an obligation to speak up."" Authorities are offering a $22,500 reward for any information leading to the arrest and successful prosecution of a suspect, the City of Akron announced Sunday night. Calling gun violence in the U.S. an epidemic, Malik said the incident was the latest in a long line of shootings that have taken place across the nation. ""Here, the sheer number of victims is shocking and deeply concerning,"" Malik said. ""We can only be thankful that of the 25 individuals injured, we did not have more fatalities."" ""This morning, our city is reeling after the devastation of senseless violence,"" Malik and Capt. Michael Miller, an Akron police public information officer, said in a joint statement earlier Sunday. ""With more than two dozen victims, the pain and trauma reverberates across all of Akron today as we search for answers. As with all acts of violence in our city, our hearts are with the victims and their loved ones."" The hospital system Summa Health treated 15 patients who were involved in the shooting, a spokesperson confirmed in a statement to CBS News. One person was pronounced dead on arrival and another was being treated for serious injuries, with their condition listed as critical on Sunday morning, according to the statement. The remaining 13 people suffered injuries that were not considered life-threatening, and they were either in the process of being discharged or discharged already. ",CBSnews,US

Josh Jones and Laura Keck have prosecuted hundreds of cases, but no case has troubled them quite like the murder of Becky Bliefnick. Josh Jones: You put yourself in the mind of Becky Bliefnick in the last moments of her life, the fear that she had to be feeling … You can't walk out of that house and not be affected by it. Becky was just 41 years old when, on the afternoon of Feb. 23, 2023, her own father discovered her lifeless on the bathroom floor of her Quincy, Illinois, home. She had been dead for hours — shot a total of 14 times. None of the wounds were immediately fatal. Josh Jones: It took her minutes to die. … It was an emotional response for both of us to realize not just that she had been executed … but that her last minutes were lying on a floor alone, in the dark, in extreme pain, waiting to die. Quincy is a quiet town along the Mississippi River where violent crimes are rare and unsettling. Laura Keck: She was a nurse … who had three children. … I think people were just horrified that a mother of three young boys could be shot and killed in her own home. Sarah Reilly is Becky's older sister and her only sibling. She lives in New York, but was away on vacation with her husband, Bret Reilly, when they got that life-changing call. Sarah Reilly: You just wanna wake up and have it not be real. Bret Reilly: It's a living nightmare. … How fast can we get to the airport, fly back to New York, unpack our swimsuits and pack funeral clothes, and get out to Quincy, Illinois, and just holding each other up in screaming grief. Erin Moriarty: How would you both describe her? Bret Reilly: Selfless. Sarah Reilly: That really captures it. … She thought of everybody that was in her life as somebody important and somebody special. … The kids were her world. Becky's three sons – ages 12, 10 and 5 – were not at home at the time of the murder. They were staying with their father, Tim Bliefnick, about a mile away. The couple was in the process of getting divorced. Tim says that when he couldn't reach Becky on the 23rd, he contacted her father. Tim says that when he couldn't reach Becky on the 23rd, he contacted her father. Tim Bliefnick: He said, 'Hey, I haven't been able to get a hold of her either. I'm gonna go over to the house."" … What happened to Becky should have never happened. And it just— it still doesn't—at times, it still just doesn't feel real. Police quickly determined that the killer had broken into Becky's home by prying open an upstairs window in one of the children's bedrooms. Video shows a police officer later reenacting how investigators believe the assailant scaled the house. Josh Jones: The person had climbed up on there … there was a patio chair that was pulled over … They walked past Becky's windows in her bedroom … And then they went to a room of one of the boys … and they pried open, broke the window open, uh, went in. … You could almost trace their path … to Becky's room. They had kicked in or broken in the door violently. … Becky then ran into the bathroom turned around and … got shot. Erin Moriarty: What time do you believe the intruder entered the house? Josh Jones: So, it would've been around 1:11 in the morning, because we know that at 1:11 and 10 seconds, Becky tried to call 911 on her cell phone. She dialed 9-1-1-2-6. And the phone was knocked out of her hand, and it was found behind the door. Nothing appeared to be stolen, and neighbors didn't see or hear anything. But there was evidence left behind: a partial shoe print near the point of entry, eight spent 9-millimeter shell casings, and small pieces of plastic on the floor around Becky's body. Josh Jones: We thought it was unusual when we saw that. It was like, ""OK, what is this?"" Detectives canvassing the neighborhood looking for surveillance video didn't have to go far. Becky's next door neighbors, the Heimanns, had installed a camera on the side of their house after a car break-in more than a year earlier. It pointed at their driveway, which ran alongside Becky's house. Erin Moriarty: What does it record? Taylor Heimann: It records movement. So anytime it senses movement, it will notify us on our phones. The Heimanns' camera didn't capture anything on the night of the murder, but it did capture something unusual about 24 hours earlier. We have slowed down some of the videos so you can see them better. At 1:05 a.m., a person was seen walking down the driveway towards the back of Becky's house. And what appeared to be that same person was seen again 48 minutes later — this time, walking in the opposite direction. The camera had also captured a similar incident — about a week earlier – on February 14, Valentine's Day. Taylor Heimann: I saw that one in the middle of the night. … And texted Becky immediately. I told her …we just saw somebody in the driveway. And she responded not till the next morning— Erin Moriarty: And what did she say when she responded? Taylor Heimann: That's when she told me that she hadn't seen anything. But she thought she had been hearing voices in her backyard and her motion light go on. And she was very paranoid. At the time, the Heimanns thought it was a neighborhood prowler looking for something to steal. But now, with Becky dead, they began to wonder. And investigators did, too. Josh Jones: Officers went around the entire neighborhood trying to find more video. … And we were able to find a video from a house … and we were able to find video from the Quincy bus barn. … And those videos showed a person … riding a bike in the direction of Becky's house. After analyzing the recorded times of the videos, authorities began to suspect that the person seen on the bike was the same person seen in the driveway. Josh Jones: Every time you see a person at the Heimann residence, you see a person riding a bike down the road, just a few minutes before you see a person on that Heimann video. And even though there was no video from the Heimann residence on the morning Becky was killed, there was video of a person on a bike riding in the direction of Becky's house right before the murder, and in the opposite direction right after. Laura Keck: And this is not a part of town that people ride bikes in the middle of the night in winter. … And, so, when you have this surveillance video … and it exactly matches the timeline … that's suspicious. But there was one big problem:  you can tell absolutely nothing from the videos — only that the bike did not appear to have reflectors on the wheels. Erin Moriarty: I mean, you can't see — Josh Jones: No. Erin Moriarty: — whether it's male, female. Josh Jones: No. It's terrible. Laura Keck: It's terrible. The video is terrible. Authorities needed more leads, and they would get one from Becky's sister that would point them in a very specific direction. When Becky's sister Sarah and brother-in-law Bret learned of her murder, they say one person came to mind as the prime suspect: Becky's estranged husband Tim Bliefnick. Sarah Reilly: I told Bret it was Tim. Bret Reilly: Of course, it was Tim. Sarah Reilly: I said — Erin Moriarty: Right away? Bret Reilly: Right away. Tim and Becky met when they were students at Quincy University, but it wasn't until two years after graduating that they began dating. Erin Moriarty: And how would you describe Becky back then? Tim Bliefnick: Happy, fun. … She was beautiful. The two eventually moved in together, married, and started a family. Becky quit her job in pharmaceutical sales to become a stay-at-home mom, while Tim continued his successful career in the recycling industry. Tim Bliefnick: I thought this was it. You know, I'm gonna be 85 and sitting on a porch in a rocking chair with her talking about how good life was. But things didn't turn out that way. Sarah Reilly: She was … very happy with their marriage for probably the first … five years. And then, you know, things started to change. … He got progressively … more manipulative and controlling … He didn't do any of the work ever at the house. Shannon Zanger is Becky's close friend. Shannon Zanger: When she'd come over and we'd talk husbands, as wives do … she felt like she was shouldering most of the load … I thought, man, I really have a partner here and she doesn't seem to have that partnership. Shannon and Sarah say the relationship only became more strained when Becky decided to go back to school to become a nurse. Sarah Reilly: He not only did not support her, he did not increase his time with the boys. While Tim acknowledges that he wasn't in favor of Becky taking on a career in nursing, he says it was out of concern for her well-being. He spoke exclusively with ""48 Hours."" Tim Bliefnick: Because of the stress piece of it … Erin Moriarty: Were you worried you'd have to pick up more of the work with the kids? Tim Bliefnick: Not at all. … I've always been involved with the kids every day. In January 2021, after 11 years of marriage, Tim filed for divorce. Although he wouldn't discuss the specifics of why he filed, he hinted that it had to do with what he saw as a change in Becky's personality after she became a nurse. Tim Bliefnick: She struggled with patience and stress a lot, especially when it came to the kids, and it — it created some conflict. But Sarah Reilly says Tim is just making excuses, and she believes the reason Tim filed for divorce is because he couldn't control Becky. She says Becky was a loving mother and tried in vain to salvage the marriage. Sarah Reilly: She wanted to go to marriage counseling with him and he refused. Whatever the reason for the divorce might have been, one thing is certain: things between the two soon turned contentious. According to divorce documents, they fought over just about everything: money, the marital home and custody of the kids. Erin Moriarty: I don't understand why it got so contentious if you were the one who wanted to get out. Tim Bliefnick: Yeah, I was the one that wanted to get out and I tried on several occasions. … But … there are details that I'm — I'm not — that are hard to talk about that happened in the divorce. In the months after Tim filed for divorce, Becky began voicing concerns about Tim's behavior. She sent a text to a friend: ""He has screamed in my face, he shoved me in front of the kids, and has thrown things across the room..."" And she texted another friend, ""I truly believe Tim has serious mental health problems and he is becoming more vengeful and unpredictable …"" But Tim says it was Becky who was vengeful. Tim Bliefnick: She … told people I had an affair … which is untrue. She tried to tell people that I was an alcoholic, which is untrue. … She was telling people these things because (sighs) she was angry about the divorce. At one point, Tim sought an order of protection against Becky. He alleged Becky ""stalked"" and ""harassed"" him. He also referenced an incident where he said Becky had become ""combative"" during a disagreement at a parent-teacher night. BECKY BLIEFNICK (cellphone video): I'm asking for the letter. TIM BLIEFNICK: Stop. I'm asking you to stop harassing me and stop following me. BECKY BLIEFNICK: I'm not harassing you. I'm asking you … He offered video of the incident as proof. TIM BLIEFNICK: I will make a copy for you. BECKY BLIEFNICK: I don't want you to tape me. Don't tape me. TIM BLIEFNICK: Then stop doing this. BECKY BLIEFNICK: Don't tape me. I don't – TIM BLIEFNICK: Then stop doing this. BECKY BLIEFNICK: I didn't ask you to tape me. Erin Moriarty: Do you really think she was trying to hurt him in that video? Casey Schnack: I don't think anybody was trying to hurt anybody. I think you have two parents that were having a disagreement … and didn't know how to deal with it. Casey Schnack was one of Tim's divorce attorneys. Erin Moriarty: The judge didn't grant that order of protection. Casey Schnack: Did not grant it. No. Days after Tim filed for that order of protection, and more than a year before her death, Becky sent her sister Sarah this text: ""If something ever happens to me, please make sure the number one person of interest is Tim…"" She would later make similar statements to friends. Sarah Reilly: I said, ""What did he do?"" … and that, uh, text was prompted by, uh, the murder of one of her, um colleagues … One of the nurses that she knew … was murdered by, um, her partner … That scared her. … She felt like, this could happen, this is real. Tim Bliefnick: I never understood where that came from. … We would get into arguments, and sometimes, we would get loud, but … that's all it amounted to. Sarah says she recommended Becky seek help from a domestic abuse organization and, eventually, Becky filed for an order of protection against Tim. In her petition, she alleged that Tim ""entered her residence without permission."" She also said that he ""repeatedly falsified interactions"" between the two. That order of protection was not granted. But a judge did ultimately order Tim and Becky stay away from each other's residences except when exchanging their kids. And the judge also ordered Tim to return a 9-millimeter handgun that Becky had gifted him when they were together. Sarah Reilly: He was into, um, you know, recreational shooting. … she wanted that particular gun back. … Because the gun was in her name. But Becky never got it back. And it was a 9-millimeter handgun that was later used to kill her. Tim Bliefnick: I have not seen that gun in three years. … I didn't have it. Becky was killed one week before the divorce case was set to go to trial. When Sarah Reilly informed law enforcement of their history, Tim became a person of interest. Authorities kept digging, and days later, they found a bike — with no reflectors on the wheels—just like the one seen on those surveillance videos. Erin Moriarty: How close was that bike that you found to Tim's house? Josh Jones: Less than half a block. They then executed a search warrant on Tim's house and car as Tim looked on. And on March 13, 2023, just over two weeks after Becky's death, Tim Bliefnick was arrested and charged with her murder. Tim Bliefnick: I can't even fathom the idea of considering murdering somebody, like I can't. Tim's divorce attorney Casey Schnack would become his defense attorney, and she says she's convinced police got it wrong. Casey Schnack: He knew how much those kids meant to her and how much … she meant to them. He wouldn't do this to them. He wouldn't. When Tim Bliefnick was arrested, it made national news in large part because of an appearance he made alongside his parents and brothers on the game show ""Family Feud."" STEVE HARVEY | ""Family Feud"" host: Alright Tim, we talked to 100 married people. What's the biggest mistake you made at your wedding? TIM BLIEFNICK: Honey, I love you but, said ""I do."" The episode was filmed in 2019, nearly two years before Tim filed for divorce, but because of the charges he now faced, it had people talking. And there was also chatter about Tim's appearance in his mug shot, although it was no surprise to Becky's family. Sarah Reilly: We had seen through social media … the deterioration of his appearance and that went hand in hand with the deterioration of his mental state over the course of the divorce. But Tim says that's not the case and that he had been growing out his hair for a fundraiser for cancer research. Tim Bliefnick: I'm not a violent person. I'm not an angry person. I've never been that way. Tim's attorney Casey Schnack was determined to prove his innocence. She says just because Tim and Becky were going through a messy divorce, it doesn't mean he killed her. Casey Schnack: It wasn't pretty, but the things that they were fighting over were not monumental things. Erin Moriarty: You know there were a number of friends—Becky's friends, who said that she expressed great fear of Tim. Casey Schnack: Mm-hmm. Yeah. … That's a lot of girl talk. … I've never seen any pictures of her with bruises, or marks, any allegations of him beating on her … Nothing. But Adams County prosecutors Josh Jones and Laura Keck say even though there may not have been physical abuse, there was emotional abuse — evident in Tim's texts to Becky. Erin Moriarty: What do his text messages reveal? Laura Keck: So, I would say what they reveal is somebody … who wants power and control. He wants to control the relationship. He wants to control how people perceive him. Tim denies that. Tim Bliefnick: No. She wasn't the one that was emotionally abused. … I tried to create space. I tried to stay out of her life. And Tim says he has an alibi for the time of the murder. He says he was home with their three kids. They were sleeping over that night because Becky had asked him to keep them an extra night. Casey Schnack: She told him that she wasn't feeling well … And he said, that's fine… That's how you want to see two people in a divorcing situation act with kids. But Jones and Keck believe Tim saw an opportunity. Josh Jones: She showed weakness to a predator. … And that's what predators do, when they see a weakness, they attack. And they also say that explains the intruder's point of entry: an upstairs window in one of the kids' bedrooms. Josh Jones: If you're a random intruder … why do you go to the second-floor window? … You go past not just one window, but … three windows that are possible entrance points. … And you just happen to get lucky that it's a little boy's room that's not there that night. But Schnack points to what she says is a lack of physical evidence tying Tim to the crime. No murder weapon or bloody clothing was found, and while police did seize pairs of Tim's shoes, they weren't able to match them to that partial shoeprint found at the scene. Casey Schnack: They took every single pair of athletic shoes that they thought would be a match. They didn't find any that — that were a suitable match. Schnack also points out that Tim's DNA wasn't found on that patio chair that investigators believe was used by the killer to climb onto Becky's roof. Casey Schnack: Nothing on that was connected to Tim. … They took every pair of gloves from Tim's car, house and — and — that they could find and none of those gloves had any — anything that linked him to this crime. But if Tim didn't kill Becky, who did? Tim Bliefnick: If I knew that answer, I would've given that name or whoever it was a long time ago. Tim's attorney says that she believes investigators should have given more weight to the idea that it could have been a random prowler who killed Becky in a break-in gone wrong. Remember, police found those videos of a person on a bike and a person walking down Becky's neighbor's driveway. Tim insists it's not him in those videos. Casey Schnack: You cannot say with any degree of certainty who that person is on any of those videos … All you see is a bike without reflectors. And even though a bike with no reflectors on the wheels was found less than half a block from Tim's house, Schnack says that doesn't mean anything. Casey Schnack: His DNA was not found on that bike. … And we don't even know that the bike that was found … is the same bike that was in the video. But prosecutors Jones and Keck say they did find evidence tying Tim to that bike. Josh Jones: We were able to download information off his phone, and we found that Mr. Bliefnick had a, what I'll call burner or fake Facebook account, for the name ""John Smith."" And they say that ""John Smith"" Facebook account appeared to have been looking at this bike for sale: a blue Schwinn with no reflectors on the wheels— just like that bike that was found. Casey Schnack: I mean, I have a fake Facebook account. … I'm not proud of it, but people do it. Erin Moriarty: Isn't it a bit of a problem though that on his phone, he gets an alert for that blue bike? Casey Schnack: Sure. … Are there similarities? Sure, but … that's not the only abandoned bike that's been found around town. Jones and Keck say they're confident they got the right guy. Josh Jones: The detectives followed the evidence exactly where it took them. And there was one inescapable conclusion, that it was Mr. Bliefnick. But despite their confidence, they soon faced quite a challenge. When Tim was arrested, he was ordered held without bond. He had a right to a speedy trial, which he took — meaning prosecutors would be required to try the case within 90 days of Tim's arrest. Josh Jones: We were gonna be ready come hell or high water. But did they have enough to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt? Laura Keck: Juries expect a confession. They expect that DNA evidence that says one in 500 million … We're gonna have to show them that's not what we have here. On May 23, 2023, exactly three months after Becky Bliefnick was gunned down in her home, Tim Bliefnick went on trial for her murder. JOSH JONES (trial opening statements): The defendant looked down at Becky and he pointed a gun at her. And he pulled the trigger. Prosecutors Josh Jones and Laura Keck began by methodically laying out the evidence they say points directly to Tim, starting with those odd pieces of plastic that were found around Becky's body. They say investigators determined that they were shreds from an ALDI grocery store bag. Josh Jones: And then in the defendant's house, we found stacks of ALDI bags. He had fired through an ALDI bag, either in an attempt to muffle the sound or to catch his shell casings. And prosecutors say that in the process, DNA was left behind on a piece of that plastic. An expert testified that it was more likely than not that Tim was a contributor. And Tim also couldn't be excluded from DNA that was found under Becky's fingernails. Josh Jones: That was three times more likely to have come from the defendant or a male relative from the lineage of the defendant. CASEY SCHNACK (trial opening statements): And this case, is dripping with reasonable doubt. But defense attorney Casey Schnack says that evidence is far from definitive. Casey Schnack: Everybody in town has ALDI bags that they're hoarding. … They could have came from Becky's house. Erin Moriarty: With DNA from him? Casey Schnack: Well, because they transferred stuff back and forth for the boys in ALDI bags. Erin Moriarty: There was DNA found under Becky's fingernails. Casey Schnack: Yeah … And it was just as likely to be Tim's as any one of the boys. Prosecutors also told the jury that police found a crowbar in Tim's basement. And they called an expert to the stand who testified that she compared it to tool marks left on the window that was pried open at Becky's. While there were microscopic consistencies, she couldn't say with scientific certainty that that crowbar made those marks. Casey Schnack: The expert said that that was inconclusive. … Inconclusive leaves a jury guessing and speculating, which they are not allowed to do. The jury heard about the couple's acrimonious divorce and from Becky's sister—and several friends— who testified about those fears Becky had raised about Tim. Several of them acknowledged that they regretfully didn't take steps to help her. Sarah Reilly: ""How could Tim do that? I've known Tim forever."" … When she reached out to people, that's what they said. Bret Reilly: In hindsight, of course, we should have done more. … There's only one person that believed it was true and that was Becky herself. And the prosecution argued that the timing of the murder is significant. Remember, Becky was killed one week before the couple's divorce case was set to go to trial. And prosecutors told the jury, there was something even bigger than money and custody that was going to come into play. JOSH JONES (trial opening statements): Becky didn't want their three children to be around the defendant's father unsupervised. They didn't tell the jury why, but ""48 Hours"" uncovered court documents that reveal Becky had gathered witnesses who she said planned to testify about Tim's father, Ray Bliefnick, and would allege that he had a ""history of perversion and abusing minor children"" many years earlier. The alleged victims were not Becky and Tim's children. Becky sought an order of protection against Ray, but a judge denied her request.  In a letter, Ray's lawyer wrote that Ray ""vehemently denies the claims"" and that he has ""never been charged with any criminal offense"" stemming from the allegations. Josh Jones: Information was going to come out that he didn't want to come out. … and he started to feel like he was losing control. The prosecution pointed out that on the day of Becky's murder, hours before anyone except her killer knew that she was dead, Tim brought a kids' basketball hoop to his father's house. Josh Jones: He's doing that because he knows Becky's not gonna be a problem anymore. Becky didn't want those boys around Ray. And in Tim's mind, that problem was solved because Becky was dead. Casey Schnack: I really don't buy that. I— Erin Moriarty: Why not? Casey Schnack: Because the boys weren't restricted from seeing Ray to begin with. … They just couldn't see him without supervision. And Schnack says those allegations were old news. Casey Schnack: All of those allegations were in pleadings that … her attorneys had filed and at that point were already a matter of public record. … It doesn't make sense that he would throw his life away over a divorce and keeping information out of the public eye that quite frankly was already out. But the prosecution wasn't done. The jury was also shown numerous damaging searches found on Tim's phone like, ""How to open my door with a crowbar,"" ""How to make a homemade pistol silencer,"" and ""How to clean gunpowder off your hands."" Laura Keck: It was mind-boggling. Josh Jones: It was mind-boggling, yeah. And remember that person caught on camera in Becky's neighbor's driveway on Valentine's Day, about a week before the murder? Well, prosecutors say that right after that sighting, Tim made more than 200 searches online for a specific license plate and a car VIN number. It turns out that that license plate and VIN number belonged to a man whom Becky was dating, and his truck was parked in Becky's driveway at the time. Laura Keck: And for somebody with power and control issues, you realize that your prior significant other is now in a relationship with somebody, that they're spending the night on Valentine's Day. And then the minute you get back to your home at 1:10 in the morning, you're searching their license plate number and their VIN number, that's somebody who's lost control. Tim insists he had learned about Becky's new relationship months earlier. Tim Bliefnick: I actually didn't care. Erin Moriarty: It sounds like you were kind of obsessed 'cause — Tim Bliefnick: No. He declined to go into more detail about specific trial evidence, citing legal proceedings, but his lawyer spoke for him. Casey Schnack: I mean, if I'm gonna be checking out my husband's new girlfriend, I'm gonna be doing it late at night after my kids are asleep. Erin Moriarty: So, it's just a coincidence that the night you see that prowler … at the next door neighbor's driveway — Casey Schnack: Mm-hmm. Erin Moriarty: — and his truck is there, it's just a coincidence that just minutes later, Tim is doing research on the VIN number and the license tag. Casey Schnack: That's not Tim in that video. Erin Moriarty: What about the searches that were found on Tim's phone? Casey Schnack: There's no date or time as to when those searches were done. So, we don't know if they were done before the murder, and we don't know if they were done after the murder. Before they rested the case, prosecutors dropped one more piece of evidence: spent shell casings that were found in Tim's home. An expert testified that she compared them to the shell casings found at the crime scene and determined that 27 of them had been fired from the exact same gun used in the murder. Josh Jones: Each firearm leaves its own fingerprint on every shell casing that it fires. … It was the same gun that killed Becky Bliefnick that fired these shell casings that were found in Tim Bliefnick's residence. Casey Schnack: That's the expert's opinion … At the end of the day, it's subject to human error like anything else. But when it was the defense's turn to call witnesses, it chose to call none. Erin Moriarty: You could have brought in your own expert to say those did not match. Casey Schnack: Hmm, I guess we could have, but we were strapped on time and funds. Erin Moriarty: You've got a man's life on the line. Casey Schnack: Mm-hmm. And he didn't want us to do that. It was a risky move, but one that may have paid off for the defense, because when the jury began deliberating, they took a vote—and there was a holdout. Casey Schnack: Sometimes you just need one. When the jury began deliberating after a six-day trial, Tim Bliefnick was on edge. Tim Bliefnick: it was miserable, because I was essentially waiting for them to decide my fate. Inside that jury room, one juror was undecided. Laura Keck: Our stomachs were in knots. We were beyond stressed. But four hours later, a verdict. Sarah Reilly: When they passed the paper from the jury box to the clerk … that was … very difficult to know that there's a possibility that he could get away with it. JUDGE ROBERT ADRIAN: Would the clerk read the verdicts, please? CLERK: We the jury find the defendant Timothy Bliefnick guilty of first-degree murder. Guilty. Laura Keck: It was a sense of relief that they had found him guilty, but it was also a sense of these three little boys have now lost both parents … it's not a celebration. When we sat down with Tim Bliefnick, it was just over a month after his conviction. He was still awaiting sentencing. Erin Moriarty: Did you ever imagine you would be here? Tim Bliefnick: No, no, never. … At times, it's felt like I'm watching somebody else's life from the outside. Like it, it can't be me. … But the only thing I can do right now is what we are doing … filing an appeal. I have to — I have to believe in that process 'cause if not (emotional) — Erin Moriarty: Tell me what you're thinking right now. Tim Bliefnick: My kids. … I just want them to know that I love them, and I miss them … I'm innocent. I didn't kill Becky. But Becky's sister says Tim is right where he belongs. Sarah Reilly: He called my dad to set him up to find her. … That alone shows how cruel he really is. … As agonizing as our pain is …  I want him to understand that his worst crime was against his children. And that's the message Sarah delivered directly to Tim during her victim impact statement right before he was sentenced on Aug. 11, 2023. Sarah Reilly: Your children's future will be forever impacted by your crime. They're already suffering. … Maybe you should have Googled ""childhood PTSD"" in between your internet searches for homemade silencers and VIN numbers. Judge Robert Adrian had the option of sentencing Tim to anywhere between 45 years to life. JUDGE ROBERT ADRIAN: Mr. Bliefnick, you researched this murder, you planned this murder … You broke into her house, and you shot her: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 times (raised voice). The court believes that the appropriate sentence … would be natural life in prison. Life in prison without the possibility of parole. Prosecutors Jones and Keck say the punishment fits the crime, but even they don't consider it justice. Josh Jones: If I had a magic wand, I would bring Becky back to life … Tim can spend the rest of his life out of prison. That would be justice. … But I can't. … what we can do is we can hold her killer accountable and that's all we can do. Now, Becky's family is left to focus on all they have left of her… memories…  and the loves of her life… her three boys, who are now living with her parents. Sarah Reilly: We will all work together to make sure those boys have the life they deserved. … And we started a GoFundMe to support the boys. And Becky's family and friends hope that Becky's mission in life will now become her legacy. Sarah Reilly: Becky would have wanted positive change to happen. She would want somebody else's life to be saved. … If we can learn anything, if somebody reaches out to you and says that — that they're scared, that they believe that their partner … or whoever it is, is capable of violence, you need to believe them and make an active effort to make sure they're safe. Tim Bliefnick has not been allowed any contact with his kids since his arrest.

Serial killer Rodney Alcala's trail of murder,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/serial-killer-rodney-alcala-the-killing-game/,"Police say a photographer and one-time contestant on ""The Dating Game"" was also a chameleon and a serial killer —perhaps the deadliest in U.S. history.","This story previously aired on Sept. 15, 2018. Produced by Gayane Keshishyan Mendez and Tom Seligson. When ""48 Hours"" first investigated the case of  Rodney Alcala, he had been convicted of the murder of five California women.  But it wasn't over; he would be tied to other cold cases. A series of photos that Alcala had taken and posted online by ""48 Hours"" would lead to one woman finally finding out what happened to her sister who had vanished almost 40 years ago. How many other cases are there? In Los Angeles in 1968, 8-year-old Tali Shapiro was walking to school when a car pulled up alongside her. Chris Camacho | Former detective, LAPD:  I was out doing my patrols. We just started our shift that day. And I was driving down Sunset Boulevard. And I had received a call, a beige-colored car with no license plates following this little girl. Steve Hodel | Former detective, LAPD: A Good Samaritan, a witness, sees the little girl, the little 8-year-old Tali get in the car. Thinks it's suspicious, follows him, and puts a call into LAPD. Former Los Angeles Police Officer Chris Camacho reached the location and knocked on the door. Chris Camacho: I said, ""Police officer. Open the door. I need to talk to you."" This male appeared at the door. I will always remember that face at that door, very evil face. And he says, ""I'm – I'm in the shower. I got to get dressed."" And I told him, ""OK, you got 10 seconds."" … Finally, I kicked the door in. The image will be with me forever. We could see in the kitchen that there was a body on the floor, lot of blood. Matt Murphy | Orange County Deputy D.A.: They say a picture says a thousand words and that image of those little white Mary Janes on that floor with that metal bar that he used to strangle her with, and that puddle of blood, it just looks like too much blood to come out of a —   a tiny little 8-year-old like that. Chris Camacho:  There was no breathing. …We all thought she was dead. Camacho began frantically searching the house for her attacker. Moments later, he walked back into the kitchen and witnessed a miracle. Chris Camacho: She was gagging and trying to breathe, and I thought one for the good guys. She's going to make it. Clinging to life, Tali was rushed to the hospital. Matt Murphy: Had it not been for that police officer, Tali Shapiro would have died on Rodney Alcala's kitchen floor. Chris Camacho: We started searching the residence. There was a lot of photograph equipment and all of us were amazed at the amount of photographs that he had there of young girls, very young girls. We found a lot of ID, picture ID of a Rodney Alcala. He was a student at UCLA. The suspect, 25-year-old Rodney Alcala, had slipped through the officers' fingers. Chris Camacho: When I kicked in the front door … the suspect went out the back door. With Alcala in the wind, former Detective Steve Hodel was grasping at thin air. Steve Hodel: We kept coming up empty. Back then, you know, we didn't have a lot of the forensics you have today. Steve Hodel: He was a snake charmer. I went and talked to his professor at UCLA. … He says Rod Alcala wouldn't hurt anybody. He's a great guy. He truly believed that, you know. And —   and a lot of people did. Rodney Alcala was born in San Antonio, Texas, in 1943. His father abandoned the family when he was young. At 17, Alcala enlisted in the Army, but there were problems:  allegations of sexual misconduct and a nervous breakdown. The Army discharged him. Steve Braccini | Former cold case detective, NYPD: The military realized in 1963 that they had him … he was a sexual deviant. In 1969, the FBI put Rodney Alcala on its Most Wanted List. But finding Alcala was going to be no simple matter. Matt Murphy: Rodney Alcala after raping and —   and almost killing Tali Shapiro, he fled to New York. He made friends. He —   he charmed people. He got into NYU film school. None of his fellow students suspected that their popular classmate had a double life which had the makings of a film itself — a horror film. Three years after his attack on Tali Shapiro, Alcala's dark side once again emerged. JUNE 1971 His next victim: Cornelia Michael Crilley, a 23-year-old flight attendant for TWA. Leon Borstein |Cornelia's boyfriend:  She had a beautiful face. She carried herself extremely sophisticatedly. Leon Borstein: I was living with her temporarily while she was getting her own apartment right around the corner to share with another stewardess. Cornelia Crilley had spent the day moving in. When Borstein came home from work, he was surprised to find her door locked. And no one answered the phone. Melissa Mourges | Manhattan prosecutor: When her boyfriend —   was trying to reach her, and was unable —   the police came. It was a horrible scene. Prosecutor Melissa Mourges was struck by the ferocious nature of the killing. Melissa Mourges: She had been —   stripped naked. She was —   strangled with a —  nylon stocking. And there was a bite mark on her breast. Steve Braccini: Obviously the cause of death is strangulation. She's bound. She's held. There's something stuffed in her mouth, obviously to keep her from screaming. The police focused in on Cornelia's murder, but with almost 2,000 killings in New York in 1971 investigators could not close the case. Martha Bashford | Manhattan prosecutor: They had no real leads. We didn't have the forensic tools that we have – today … so they did what they could. …And the case just went cold. And it stayed cold for 40 years. Rodney Alcala wasn't even a suspect. After the murder, he changed his name to John Berger and moved to New Hampshire. He landed a job as a counselor at an arts and drama camp for girls. There, he made a lasting impression on the campers. Matt Murphy: Two girls went to their local post office and they looked and there was Rodney Alcala's photo on the FBI Ten Most Wanted list. And they looked up and said, ""Oh my gosh, that's Mr. Berger."" Steve Hodel: They report it to the dean. He calls the authorities. They arrest him, take him into custody. I get a phone call from the FBI saying we've got your man in custody. He's ready to be picked up. Police in California were eager to charge him for Tali Shapiro's brutal assault, but her family had left the country. With no main witness, prosecutors had no choice but to offer Alcala a deal:  plead guilty to a lesser charge of child molestation and register as a sex offender.  He took the deal, but the judge's sentence stunned those working the case. Matt Murphy: He received one year-to-life … and the parole board let him go after 34 months after what he did to Tali Shapiro. So less than three years later, Rodney Alcala was a free man again. Chris Camacho: I was flabbergasted to say the least. It just amazed me. And Alcala had no trouble charming his way back into the swing of things. Matt Murphy: He was hired by the Los Angeles Times to work … as a typesetter. He took photos at weddings. And he was a registered sex offender during all of that, and nobody ever checked. Even worse, he was chosen to be a contestant on ""The Dating Game"" TV show — ""The Bachelor"" of its day. What no one knew was that Rodney Alcala was already a serial killer. Matt Murphy:  From all outward appearances Rodney Alcala was a handsome, charming, smart young man —   that wouldn't hurt a fly. The woman who won a date with him ended up backing out, saying she found him ""creepy."" Her intuition probably saved her life.  Others would not be so fortunate. Steve Braccini: We'll never know how many women are lucky … 'Cause every woman that crossed that guy's path was a potential victim. In 1977, Rodney Alcala was out of prison and living in New York. It was bad news for the New York cops who already had their hands full. A homegrown serial killer – known as ""Son of Sam"" – was terrorizing the city. By this time, the Cornelia Crilley case had been cold for six years with no suspects.  Rodney Alcala was only in the city a week before adding to the New York crime wave. His next victim: a 23-year old musician and artist named Ellen Hover. Anita Feinberg: Ellen was a sweet, gentle soul. Anita Feinberg and Ellen Hover met as teenagers. Anita Feinberg: Ellen was a very dear college friend. We roomed together for some time. …She never confused what she had with who she was. Ellen Hover came from a prominent show business family. Her father owned the famed Hollywood nightclub Ciro's. Her godfathers were Sammy Davis Jr. and Dean Martin. Anita Feinberg: Her mom called me and said, ""Anita, have you heard from Ellen?"" And I said, ""No."" … She said, ""Think hard. Nobody can find Ellen."" … I didn't think anything of it until a couple weeks —   until it hit the newspapers. Her family's high profile made the story front-page news as the NYPD kept up the hunt for her. Steve Braccini: The detective did a great job for a missing person's case. There was a lot of calls. He did a lotta work, lotta legwork. Detectives thought they were onto something when they found an important clue in her apartment. Melissa Mourges | Manhattan prosecutor: Ellen Hover … had marked on her calendar that she was going to see someone named John Berger on the date that she disappeared Remember, Alcala had been using the name John Berger. But at the time, the connection was never made. Melissa Mourges: Her body wasn't found until a year later, buried on the grounds of the Phelps Memorial Hospital in Westchester, near the Rockefeller Estate. Anita Feinberg: Until they actually found her, there was always a glimmer of hope … Once they found her body —   that was it. Ellen's body was so decomposed police had to use dental records to identify her. Steve Braccini: Based on the autopsy, they declared it a homicide. …there was a suspect in the murder. A fellow that they believe was the last person that she was seen with. Could that fellow have been Alcala?  Ellen had written his alias, ""John Berger"" in her calendar. Alcala, meanwhile, had left New York and was on his meandering road trip back to California. Mary Ellen O'Toole | Former FBI profiler:  He was constantly in predatory mode. … that is behavior that involves hunting human beings and that's part of a serial sexual killer. …That … is often as exciting as the actual homicide and sexual assault. At the same time Rodney Alcala was on the road, a 29-year-old woman from Texas, Christine Ruth Thornton, was traveling through the West with her boyfriend. Her sister, Kathy, was 11 years younger. Kathy Thornton: Chris was a free spirit kinda gal. So she always was up for anything. In the spring of 1977, Christine was heading to Montana with her boyfriend to pan for gold.  And she had big news. Kathy Thornton: She let my mom know that she was going to be having a baby … And then nothing more was heard. Kathy Thornton immediately feared the worst. Christine and her boyfriend had a stormy relationship. Kathy Thornton: She had been abused by him. We knew that. …I always thought that he had done something to her. Soon after Christine disappeared, Kathy Thornton began searching for answers. She undertook a systematic effort to track Christine and her boyfriend's whereabouts that would last almost 40 years —   through marriage, motherhood, divorce and a career. Kathy Thornton contacted police departments, federal agencies and hospitals. She kept copies of every phone call and letter. Kathy Thornton: This is a letter I sent to the FBI.  In 1989 I contacted the Department of Human Services … They say, ""A check at this address failed to reveal any contact with Christine Ruth Thornton."" … the Social Security Administration —  I contacted them asking if there was any employment record and there never had been an employment record. Kathy Thornton: I think the message was kind of clear. Everything was kind of …""We don't know."" ""We have nothing."" ""We can't help you."" … Looking back through this, it was staring me in the face that … she was not alive. Kathy Thornton didn't know the name Rodney Alcala —   but one day, she would. It was the spring of 1979. Rodney Alcala had been back in California for almost two years and 12-year-old Robin Samsoe was enjoying the Southern California beach life. Bridget Wilvurt was Robin's best friend. Bridget Wilvurt: We just lived to have fun. … Everybody could be complaining about being bored, and me and Robin would find ourselves doing cartwheels and back walkovers. The other love of Robin's life was her mom, Marianne. Marianne Connelly: She was probably the most loving child a mother could have. Everything she did, she did to please me. On June 20, 1979, Robin was going to start her first day of work answering phones at a ballet studio in exchange for lessons. But first, she planned to play on the beach for a few hours with Bridget. Bridget Wilvurt: I could definitely see a gentleman with dark hair. I mean he—   he honed in on us, like, really like a —   like a shark in the water, honing in on a seal. And he goes, ""Can I take your girls' pictures?"" … And Robin goes, ""Sure."" And all of a sudden, out of nowhere, pops up Jackie Young, my neighbor. You know, she goes, ""Bridget, is everything OK? Are you girls alright?"" And man, he —   he took that camera, turned his head down, and you could almost see like smoke coming off his dress shoes. He just —   he was gone. Robin and Bridget turned to go back home. Bridget Wilvurt: And Robin had thrown her beach towel and everything into her bag, and she's like, ""Well, I'm going to get going."" And I go, ""Well, take my bike and don't stop."" That was the last time anyone saw Robin alive. Robin's ballet teacher called when she did not arrive for her lesson later that day.  Her family immediately called 911. Marianne Connelly: It was probably the most horrifying time of all, you know, not knowing. Police continually questioned the one person they thought might know where Robin could've gone: her best friend, Bridget. Bridget Wilvurt: And I —   I said —   I go, ""it was the man, that man that took our picture."" On July 2, 12 days after Robin last said goodbye to her friend and rode off on her bike, a fire crew found the body of a child. Marianne Connelly: I said, ""Let's go see her."" He said, ""We can't do that."" I said, ""That's my baby, of course, I'm going to see her. Why not?"" He said, ""Because it took us three days to identify her."" I said, ""What's wrong with you people? How many little girls with long, blond hair disappear that it took you three days?"" He shook my shoulders and the tears were coming down his face, too. He says, ""There was no hair."" A fire crew conducting routine fire prevention maintenance found Robin's remains in a remote location more than 40 miles from where she was last seen. Matt Murphy | Orange County Deputy D.A: There were 12 days for the animals to scavenge Robin's remains. By the time the fire crew actually found her body, she was just bones. The pressure was on to find the killer. Bridget's description resulted in this composite sketch, which was released to the media all over Southern California. Matt Murphy: His parole officer saw that and —   and called the detectives and said, ""Look, there's a guy that used to be on my caseload. You really need to take a look at him. His name is Rodney Alcala."" It had been nearly 11 years since Alcala had left 8-year-old Tali Shapiro for dead. But Alcala was easy to find this time. He lived with his mother in Monterey Park, a stone's throw from the mountains where Robin's remains were located. Matt Murphy: They learned that he had no alibi. That he —   nobody could account for his whereabouts at that time. He was the perfect suspect. Rodney Alcala was arrested on July 24 and charged with the kidnap and murder of Robin Samsoe. Detective Pat Ellis said Huntington Beach Police got an unexpected tip when Alcala's sister came to visit her brother in jail. The conversation was being recorded. Det. Pat Ellis | Huntington Beach Police Dept.: At one point he mentions him having a storage locker in Seattle, Washington, that the cops don't know about.  …He says, ""Do me a favor, get the stuff out of there. …get it — get it cleared out."" But what Alcala didn't know was that police had found a receipt for the locker during a search of his home at the time of his arrest. Det. Pat Ellis: They beat her there … OK. And they get inside, and there's the mother lode. Matt Murphy: Hundreds if not thousands … of these different images. And there are dozens upon dozens of these young women that in the pictures clearly are in positions of supreme vulnerability with Rodney Alcala. Police learned Alcala had rented the storage facility and moved his belongings there nine days after Robin Samsoe's remains were discovered. Matt Murphy: Buried under all the stuff was this tiny little silk bag filled with earrings. Alcala claimed those were his earrings. But when police showed the jewelry to Robin's mother, she recognized a pair of gold ball studs that she said Robin often borrowed. Matt Murphy: So at that point, those are all the nuts and bolts that you need for a successful prosecution. Nearly one year after Robin Samsoe's murder, prosecutors were ready.  It was February 1980 when Rodney Alcala went on trial. Matt Murphy: Over the course of two-and-a-half months, there were almost 50 witnesses that testified. It was a very long, very difficult case. The jury convicted Alcala and sentenced him to death. Marianne Connelly to reporters: It was a poor exchange of my daughter's life, but maybe it will save someone else's by him being gone. But the relief would be short-lived. News report: Today, in a 5-1 decision, the California State Supreme Court ruled that Rodney Alcala did not receive a fair trial. The jury had been improperly told about Alcala's prior sex crimes, including the attack on Tali. The decision would devastate Robin's mother. But the ordeal was just beginning. Marianne Connelly: You know there's only one perpetrator, a little stone, but the ripples keep going and there's victims and victims and victims and victims. The Samsoe family was steadfast in the face of a second trial for the murder of Robin. They demanded justice. Marianne Connelly | Robin Samsoe's mother [in tears]: He killed my child, my child. Six years after the first verdict, a clean-cut Rodney Alcala was convicted a second time. And again, the sentence was death. Alcala had been on San Quentin's death row since 1980. Now, with a second conviction and a second death sentence, he was prepared to appeal all over again. Marianne Connelly: It was never really feeling safe that he was locked up because you always thought there was a chance he'd go free. In 2001, 22 years after he killed Robin Samsoe, a Federal Appeals Court overturned Rodney Alcala's sentence for a second time based on evidence he didn't get to present. There would be a new trial for Alcala, now in his 60s.  For Robin Samsoe's family it was unbearable. Marianne Connelly [to reporters]: We've gone through a lot of hell because of that animal. Lot of hell. Lot of hell. The path to justice for Robin Samsoe would take almost a decade more. NEW YORK | 2010 In New York City —   39 years since the murder of Cornelia Crilley and 33 years since Ellen Hover was killed – cold case detectives were finally able to identify Rodney Alcala as the killer of both women. Melissa Mourges | Manhattan Prosecutor: The strongest link was the fingerprint. There was a letter that was lodged underneath Cornelia Crilley's body. And there was a fingerprint developed from the outside of that envelope, which was unmatched for many years. And finally, through the FBIs database, there was a match. Martha Bashford | Manhattan Prosecutor: It was a significant piece of evidence, but not standing alone. Equally incriminating was the evidence left on her body. Martha Bashford: There was bite mark evidence where he had bitten her breast. Steve Braccini | Former cold case detective, NYPD:  It's his dental impression – is the one that's on her body. Martha Bashford: And, of course, we looked at all of his other cases to see similarities in sexual murders he had committed, we decided we had enough evidence. In Ellen Hover's case, investigators now knew John Berger was Rodney Alcala —   and he had been seen near the Rockefeller Estates where her body was found. Steve Braccini: I think she was abducted here in Manhattan and ultimately killed up there. Martha Bashford: We had a witness who saw somebody who looked like Rodney Alcala at that time period with a woman who looked like Ellen Hover.  The man was carrying a camera bag just like Alcala did. But Manhattan prosecutors would have to wait for California's third trial for Robin Samsoe's murder. In Orange County, Assistant D.A. Matt Murphy was ready to go to court when there was a stunning development —   DNA linked Alcala to three Los Angeles murders: Jill Barcomb, Georgia Wixted, and Charlotte Lamb.  The killing of a fourth L.A. woman, Jill Parenteau, was also tied to him. Matt Murphy: Right at that moment, we realized that not only a vicious murderer in our case, but, in fact, he is the serial killer that we always suspected him to be. In a highly unusual maneuver, the California prosecutors decided to try all five cases together. A bizarre-looking Rodney Alcala would serve as his own attorney. Mary Ellen O'Toole |Former FBI profiler: There is no better forum than to be center stage in court as your own attorney.  And you cross-examine the witnesses. … You're like God in that courtroom. Alcala even called Robin Samsoe's mother to the stand. Marianne Connelly: That was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do in my life – having him ask me questions. Desperate to impeach Connelly's character, Alcala confronted her about how, during the first trial, she had reportedly brought a gun to court. Connelly didn't deny it. Marianne Connelly: I was going to shoot him right between the eyes if I could've gotten a shot at him. But then she felt Robin's presence. Marianne Connelly:  All of a sudden I smelled her shampoo, and I felt this warmth on my hand, and I couldn't get my hand out of my purse. For the third time, Robin Samsoe's family waited as a jury decided Rodney Alcala's fate. This time there were four other families waiting with them. Dedee Parenteau | Sister of victim Jill Parenteau: One of the many things that hurts me is that that was the last face she saw. And that bothers me because he's so ugly and he's so evil. When the jury reached a verdict, it was a relief to the families who had been waiting for justice for so long. The Samsoes hoped that this would finally be the end. Juror: We, the jury, find the defendant, Rodney James Alcala, guilty of the crime of murder in the first degree. Victim Robin C. Samsoe… Matt Murphy: Rodney Alcala absolutely, 100 percent, deserves to die for what he did. In a separate penalty phase, the prosecution called to the stand a ghost from his past. Tali Shapiro [to 48 Hours]:  I'm one of Rodney Alcala's first … and one of his only living victims. …It should have stopped with me. Why in the world are there so many other victims when it was a known fact what he did to me? Rodney Alcala, addressing the same jury that convicted him of murder, makes an unusual plea for clemency. Rodney Alcala [in court]: Let me put the death penalty in perspective for you. If you desire to join in the killing of a human being, you and the families of the victims will have to wait at least 15 to 20 years while the case slowly churns through the appellate process. Matt Murphy: He wanted to play an Arlo Guthrie song, ""Alice's Restaurant,"" and there's a —   a part in that song where he talks about wanting to kill people. And he played that, incredibly, for the jury. Jurors heard the following play in court: ""I wanna kill, I wanna kill, I wanna see blood and gore and guts and veins in my teeth. Eat dead burnt bodies. I mean, kill, kill, kill, kill."" Alcala's perverse closing argument did not sway jurors. Jury member [in court]: We, the jury … determine that the penalty to be imposed upon defendant, Rodney James Alcala, to be death. Rodney Alcala had been on death row for more than 30 years.  Now convicted of five murders, it was unlikely he could win another appeal. NEW YORK | 2012 With the California cases settled, the New York prosecutors were ready for him.  But they were not expecting what would happen next. Martha Bashford: He … came back to New York in June 2012.  And by December, he pled guilty. Melissa Mourges:  It was a surprise. It was a surprise that he pled guilty because he had denied every crime he was ever accused of. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. announced Alcala's sentence: two concurrent prison terms of 25 years-to-life: D.A. Cyrus Vance to reporters: For both families, who had lost all hope that these cases would ever be solved, the pleas by Rodney Alcala, and today's sentencing brings closure to painful chapters in their lives. Melissa Mourges: The judge cried during sentencing. And Martha and I have been in this business for 35 years each. I've never seen a judge cry during a sentencing. As was agreed upon, Alcala was returned to San Quentin's death row. Melissa Mourges: I got a telephone call from Robin Samsoe's mother… and said she was so grateful that we were doing this. It's such a comfort to know that regardless of what might happen to the California cases, if for some reason he should get out, he's coming back to New York, and he's gonna serve 25-to-life. Both the New York and California prosecutors are haunted by the question:  are there other victims out there? Martha Bashford: He crisscrossed the country, West Coast, East Coast, East Coast, West Coast. Crossed through a lot of states. And I'm sure there are victims in those states. They just have to be found. Rodney Alcala had been convicted of seven murders, and was facing five separate death penalties. Kathy Thornton, who had spent the last 39 years trying to track down her missing sister, Christine, had never heard of Alcala. But her son did. It would change Thornton's quest forever. In 2013, Thornton's son had watched a ""48 Hours"" story on Alcala that lead him to CBSNews.com and a series of photos taken by Alcala of unidentified women. Kathy Thornton: I got an email from my son that said … ""I saw these pictures … take a look if you like."" Thornton scrolled through the images. She kept stopping at one of them, a picture of a beautiful woman on the back of a motorcycle. Kathy Thornton: I said, ""That sure looks like Chris"" … then I saw her little toe, her baby toe. That's one thing I always remembered about Chris was her little baby toe was different; it hooked.  I just saw that toe and I said, ""Oh yeah, that's Chris."" Thornton Googled the name ""Rodney Alcala"" and her heart almost stopped. She now believed her sister had been traveling with a notorious serial killer. Fearing the worst but still wanting answers, Thornton submitted her own DNA to a national database of missing persons. If her sister's DNA was ever submitted, they could be matched. SWEETWATER COUNTY, WYOMING Hundreds of miles away, Jeff Sheaman, a Wyoming detective, was working on a very tough cold case. Det. Jeff Sheaman | Sweetwater County Sheriff's Office: They referred to my case as ""Granger Gretta,"" because it was an unidentified female that was found in Granger, Wyoming, back in 1982. …There were a lot of aerial photos and photos from the scene when the body was found. It was a desolate area. County Prosecutor Daniel Errasmouspe recalled his predecessors had tried everything to help identify the victim. Daniel Errasmouspe: The skull was intact. And so the Wyoming State Crime Lab was able to have an artist come in and use the skull as a form of re-creating what … this victim looked like. More than 30 years had passed without a lead. All Sheaman could do was study the old files with a new set of eyes. Det. Jeff Sheaman: The bones were found next to clothing. The bones had been pulled apart, presumably by scavengers, animals.  She'd been out there about five or six years. …It was determined that this was the body of a 25- to 35-year-old female, they also told investigators at that time that she was approximately six months pregnant. Sheaman was blown away when he found the Wyoming Crime Lab had saved skin tissue and bone fragments. Det. Jeff Sheaman: All we got to do is get the ball rolling with sending it to the proper authorities to start processing it for any DNA, specifically mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondrial DNA is from the mother's side of a family.  Siblings would be revealed as a match. Det. Jeff Sheaman: I honestly thought I would be 10, 20 years retired before I received a phone call saying they had identified her. Less than a year later, Sheaman got the miraculous news.  There was a match between Kathy Thornton and the unidentified bones. Det. Jeff Sheaman: I believe there was a lotta luck that went into it, that went into this whole case. I believe that's what solved it, is a lot of luck. Suddenly, after 39 years of searching, Thornton found Christine.  Her hunt was finally over.  And the story of what happened to her sister began to unravel. During the summer of 1977, Christine split with her boyfriend and had the tragic misfortune of meeting Rodney Alcala. Their trip through the lonely Granger Prairie would be Christine's last ride. Kathy Thornton: When you see that photo, there's no doubt that she was having fun. … I think she just had no clue what he was thinking, what he was capable of doing. So, I think you're happy up until the point where you're not. And at that point there was no escape. Where would she go? Det. Joe Tomich | Sweetwater County Sheriff's Office: The location where the photo was taken to the location where Christine's remains were found were within probably just a few yards of each other. Det. Jeff Sheaman: I believe that Rodney Alcala killed Christine Thornton shortly after that photograph was taken. But before he would indict Alcala for Christine Thornton's murder, Prosecutor Errasmouspe wanted to interview him. In September 2016, he flew with the two detectives to California. Frail, and in ill health, Rodney Alcala had been moved from San Quentin to the medical unit of Corcoran Prison outside of Fresno. Det. Jeff Sheaman: When we first arrived at Corcoran we talked to some of the security staff. They said that he was borderline dementia… Whatever his condition, he was still being treated like the dangerous serial killer that he was. Det. Jeff Sheaman: We went through numerous doors, numerous gates to this peach-colored prison cell that looked like something off of a horror movie. …Paint's coming off the walls, flies buzzin' around. Daniel Errasmouspe:  Alcala's on a bed facing a wall …His feet were sticking out from underneath the sheets. And, you know, he had long toenails. Det. Jeff Sheaman: We started pulling out photographs … of the crime scene. …He took two seconds to look at that photo and he said, ""I know that area.  That's my area…"" How Alcala reacted to Christine's photograph was something the detectives will never forget. Daniel Errasmouspe: And it almost clicked [snaps fingers] like that with him, and you could almost tell that he was reliving that day. Det. Jeff Sheaman: Eventually he took the photograph, set it on his lap and he used his index finger and just started tracing her body. Tracing her body for probably five minutes. And eventually he set the paper down flat and he started tapping —   tapping on the photograph of Christine. Right over Christine's body tapping the photograph.  And eventually the tapping got louder, it got louder, he eventually looked at me, and at that point I honestly thought he would provide us more information about Christine. But it was a game. Despite his age, his infirmity, his close to 40 years behind bars —   Alcala was still the master manipulator he'd always been. Daniel Errasmouspe: He was very even-keel[ed]. Very. The only time he would show any type of a fervor in his voice would be when we point-blank ask him, ""Did you kill her?"" And he would say, ""No, no. You're crazy. You're stupid…""  And then when I asked him, ""Was she alive when you left her?"" And he said, ""yes.""… ""She was alive when I left."" That's all the prosecutor really needed to hear. Daniel Errasmouspe: The fact he admitted he was there just cinched it for me. He could deny killing her all he wants. But the fact that he admitted, as far as I'm concerned, is a confession … I decided to charge him with first-degree murder. There would be no extradition to Wyoming. Daniel Errasmouspe: He's been in prison since 1979. Why should we give him a trip? …a good place for Mr. Alcala is in the bed we left him in. So Alcala was never tried for Christine's murder. But, Kathy Thornton has finally learned what happened to her sister.  Along with seven other families, she has the answer to the question none of them ever wanted to ask. Kathy Thornton: How many others are there that, you know, did —   did the same thing Chris did? Det. Jeff Sheaman: I honestly believe in my mind, in my heart, that there's gonna be other victims … seeing how arrogant he was, knowing how charming he apparently was back in the day, and knowing how smart he is, I wouldn't doubt if there's 100, 150, maybe even 200 victims out there. Kathy Thornton: I'm hoping that with this being back in the news … that someone might recognize someone in one of those photos like we did. With his execution suspended by California's death penalty moratorium, Rodney Alcala died of natural causes in 2021, at age 77. Produced by Gayane Keshishyan Mendez and Tom Seligson.

Chinese spacecraft lands on far side of moon,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chinese-spacecraft-lands-on-moon/,"The spacecraft, part of the Chang'e moon exploration program, will collect soil and rock samples.","Just hours after NASA was forced to scrap the Florida launch of the Boeing Starliner for the second time, a Chinese spacecraft landed on the far side of the moon Sunday to collect soil and rock samples that could provide insights into differences between the less-explored region and the better-known near side. The landing module touched down at 6:23 a.m. Beijing time in a huge crater known as the South Pole-Aitken Basin, the China National Space Administration said. The mission is the sixth in the Chang'e moon exploration program, which is named after a Chinese moon goddess. It is the second designed to bring back samples, following the Chang'e 5, which did so from the near side in 2020. The moon program is part of a growing rivalry with the U.S. — still the leader in space exploration — and others, including Japan and India. China has put its own space station in orbit and regularly sends crews there. The emerging global power aims to put a person on the moon before 2030, which would make it the second nation after the United States to do so. America is planning to land astronauts on the moon again — for the first time in more than 50 years — though NASA pushed the target date back to 2026 earlier this year. U.S. efforts to use private sector rockets to launch spacecraft have been repeatedly delayed. Last-minute computer trouble nixed the planned maiden launch of Boeing's first astronaut flight Saturday from Cape Canaveral. The Boeing Starliner, carrying two astronauts bound for the International Space Station, was less than four minutes from takeoff when a computer system triggered an automatic hold. NASA initially said it would attempt another launch Sunday, before delaying the potential launch until at least Wednesday. Last month, trouble with a pressure relief valve in the Starliner's Atlas 5 rocket, along a helium leak in the capsule's propulsion module, scrubbed a May 6 launch attempt. The first piloted flight of the Starliner is Boeing's answer to SpaceX's Crew Dragon, an already operational, less expensive spacecraft that has carried 50 astronauts, cosmonauts and civilians into orbit in 13 flights, 12 of them to the space station, since an initial piloted test flight in May 2020. Earlier Saturday, a Japanese billionaire called off his plan to orbit the moon because of uncertainty over the development of a mega rocket by SpaceX. NASA is planning to use the rocket to send its astronauts to the moon. In China's current mission, the lander is to use a mechanical arm and a drill to gather up to 4.4 pounds of surface and underground material for about two days. An ascender atop the lander will then take the samples in a metal vacuum container back to another module that is orbiting the moon. The container will be transferred to a re-entry capsule that is due to return to Earth in the deserts of China's Inner Mongolia region about June 25. Missions to the moon's far side are more difficult because it doesn't face the Earth, requiring a relay satellite to maintain communications. The terrain is also more rugged, with fewer flat areas to land. ",CBSnews,US
Boeing Starliner's first astronaut flight halted at the last minute,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/boeing-starliner-launch-first-piloted-test-flight-halted-again-international-space-station/,"Nearly a month after a frustrating launch scrub, the Starliner and its two-person crew were initially cleared for a second attempt to reach orbit.","The seemingly star-crossed Boeing Starliner  — within minutes of its long-delayed blastoff on the spacecraft's first piloted test flight — was grounded again Saturday when one of three redundant computers managing the countdown from the base of the launch pad ran into a problem, triggering a last-minute scrub. Engineers initially were told to set up for another launch try Sunday, at 12:03 p.m. EDT, assuming the problem could be resolved in time. But NASA later announced the team would pass up a Sunday launch try to give engineers more time to assess the computer issue. The Starliner's test flight includes rendezvous and docking with the International Space Station. Based on the station's orbit and the Starliner's ability to to catch up, the next two launch opportunities after Sunday are Wednesday, at 10:52 a.m. EDT, and Thursday, at 10:29 a.m. NASA said the agency would provide an update Sunday. The Starliner's crew, commander Barry ""Butch"" Wilmore and co-pilot Sunita Williams, came within about two hours of launch on May 6, only to be derailed by trouble with a pressure relief valve in their Atlas 5 rocket, and a helium leak in the capsule's propulsion module. Those problems were resolved, and after a few minor snags Saturday, the countdown appeared to be ticking smoothly toward a planned launch at 12:25 p.m. EDT. But 10 seconds after the countdown came out of a planned hold at the T-minus 4-minute mark, the clocks suddenly stopped ticking. Launches to the International Space Station are timed for the moment the Earth's rotation carries the pad into alignment with the space station's orbit, a requirement when trying to rendezvous with a target moving at nearly 5 miles per second. An unplanned hold in the countdown for such missions immediately triggers a minimum 24-hour launch delay. Tory Bruno, CEO of United Launch Alliance, builder of the Atlas 5 rocket, said the issue Saturday involved one of three networked computer racks in a building at the base of the launch pad. Each rack features multiple systems, including identical circuit boards that operate together as a ""ground launch sequencer,"" managing the final steps in a countdown. The GLS computers manage events like the retraction of umbilicals and the firing of explosive bolts that free the rocket from the pad for takeoff, and all three have to be in perfect agreement for a countdown to proceed. During Saturday's launch attempt, the countdown ticked down to T-minus 4 minutes and then entered a planned four-hour hold. When the countdown resumed four minutes prior to blastoff, one of the three GLS circuit boards took longer than expected to synch up with the other two. That was enough to trigger an automatic hold at the T-minus 3-minute and 50-second mark. Engineers planned to begin troubleshooting after draining the Atlas 5 of its liquid hydrogen and oxygen propellants and gaining access to the computer room. A decision on how to proceed depended on isolating the problem and replacing and testing any suspect components. The launch team, while disappointed, took the latest delay in stride. ""You know when you're playing a game and you get a bad call, you're a little irritated at first, or a little frustrated at first, but you immediately focus on the next pitch and that's what our teams do, they're focused on the next pitch,"" said Mark Nappi, Boeing's Starliner project manager. ""As soon as we went into the launch scrub and launch turnaround, I looked out into the control room and everybody had their heads down, working the procedures to get ready for another attempt tomorrow."" Said Bruno: ""The disappointment lasts for about three seconds. And then you just immediately get busy and do your job. We'll be back."" Whenever it takes off, the long-awaited flight will be the first piloted launch of an Atlas 5, and the first for the Atlas family of rockets since astronaut Gordon Cooper took off just a few miles away on the Mercury program's final flight 61 years ago. Likewise, it will be the first piloted flight of the Starliner, Boeing's answer to SpaceX's Crew Dragon, an already operational, less expensive spacecraft that has carried 50 astronauts, cosmonauts and civilians into orbit in 13 flights, 12 of them to the space station, since an initial piloted test flight in May 2020. NASA funded development of both spacecraft to ensure the agency would be able to launch crews to the outpost even if one company's ferry ship was grounded for any reason. Already running years behind schedule because of budget shortfalls and a variety of technical problems that cost Boeing some $1.4 billion to correct, NASA had hoped to get the Starliner into orbit on May 6. But the launch was scrubbed when United Launch Alliance engineers detected trouble with a pressure-relief valve in the rocket's Centaur upper stage. The Atlas 5 was hauled off the pad and back to ULA's Vertical Integration Facility, where the Centaur valve was quickly replaced. But in the wake of the launch scrub, Boeing engineers saw signs of a small helium leak in the Starliner's propulsion system. The leak was traced to a flange in plumbing that delivered pressurized helium to drive one specific reaction control system jet in the Starliner's service module. The leak was characterized as ""very small,"" but engineers needed to show it would not drastically worsen in flight and cause problems for other thrusters. After extensive analysis and testing, mission managers concluded the spacecraft could be safely launched as is, saying that even if the leak rate was a hundred times worse than so far observed, it would not pose a risk to the crew or the mission. As it turned out, the leak rate remained within acceptable limits Saturday. Bill Harwood has been covering the U.S. space program full-time since 1984, first as Cape Canaveral bureau chief for United Press International and now as a consultant for CBS News. ",CBSnews,US

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis wrote, ""Today’s verdict represents the culmination of a legal process that has been bent to the political will of the actors involved: a leftist prosecutor, a partisan judge and a jury reflective of one of the most liberal enclaves in America — all in an effort to 'get' Donald Trump.""&nbsp; ""That this case — involving alleged misdemeanor business records violations from nearly a decade ago — was even brought is a testament to the political debasement of the justice system in places like New York City,"" he wrote. ""This is especially true considering this same district attorney routinely excuses criminal conduct in a way that has endangered law-abiding citizens in his jurisdiction. ""If the defendant were not Donald Trump, this case would never have been brought, the judge would have never issued similar rulings, and the jury would have never returned a guilty verdict. In America, the rule of law should be applied in a dispassionate, even-handed manner, not become captive to the political agenda of some kangaroo court.""

""Everyone’s saying that Donald Trump’s doing weak, weak, weak,"" Enten said Thursday. ""It‘s actually Joe Biden in my mind in the primaries, that’s doing weak, weak, weak, at least relative to history, because right now he‘s getting 87% of that primary vote for an incumbent."" Enten pointed to numbers showing that Biden has the lowest polling among all presidential incumbents in their primaries since former President George H.W. Bush in 1992, who went on to lose that election to Bill Clinton. Biden receiving 87% of his party's primary vote today compares to former Presidents George W.

POLLS INDICATE DEADLOCKED RACE WITH SIX MONTHS UNTIL ELECTION DAY  Before drilling down on Biden's numbers, Enten pushed back on those who have the impression that former President Trump’s numbers in the Republican presidential primaries are weak. ""This is actually a very strong performance for a non-incumbent after his opponents dropped out,"" the reporter declared, adding that the ""protest vote is at a historic"" low against the former president.&nbsp; Listing recent non-incumbent presidential candidates through the years, Enten said, ""Mitt Romney was getting about 71% of the votes after his opponents dropped out, Donald Trump back in 2016, 74%, Joe Biden last time around 77%.

Haley announced that she was suspending her White House campaign on March 6, the day after Trump swept 14 of 15 GOP nominating contests on Super Tuesday.

And to date, Haley has declined to endorse Trump. ""It is now up to Donald Trump to earn the votes of those in our party and beyond it who did not support him. And I hope he does that,"" Haley said as she got out of the race two months ago. The Biden campaign, reacting to Haley's comments regarding Trump, continued to make a pitch for Haley supporters. ""Nothing has changed for the millions of Republican voters who continue to cast their ballots against Donald Trump in the primaries and care deeply about the future of our democracy, standing strong with our allies against foreign adversaries, and working across the aisle to get things done for the American people – while also rejecting the chaos, division and violence that Donald Trump embodies,"" Biden campaign communications director Michael Tyler said in a statement. ""Only one candidate shares those values, and only one campaign is working hard every day to earn their support – and that’s President Biden's.""  During her speech on Wednesday, Haley targeted Biden and Republicans in Congress, but she didn't mention Trump by name. Instead, Haley said that ""a growing number of Democrats and Republicans have forgotten what makes America safe."" Haley made her comments as she gave her first address at the Washington, D.C.-based Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank known for focusing on international affairs and national security. Haley – who during her White House run advocated a muscular U.S. foreign policy to deal with global hot spots such as the war between Russia and Ukraine and the fighting between Israel and Hamas, which was often in stark contrast with Trump's America First agenda of keeping the nation out of international entanglements – joined the institute a month ago as a senior adviser. ""A loud part of each party wants us to abandon our allies, appease our enemies and focus only on the problems we have at home. They believe that if we leave the world alone, the world will leave us alone. They even say ignoring global chaos will somehow make our country more secure,"" Haley said. And she warned that ""this worldview has already put America in great danger, and the threat is mounting by the day. I have always spoken hard truths. If we don’t remember the path to peace, war will come to America, and it will claim countless lives. We have to prevent war. We have to keep Americans safe."" Haley trained most of her verbal firepower on the Democrat incumbent in the White House.  Pointing to the Biden administration's recent temporary pause of a shipment of heavy bombs to Israel over concerns that the weapons would be used in attacks on Palestinian civilians in Gaza, where the death toll has reportedly topped 35,000, per the Hamas-run Health Ministry, Haley said, ""I can hardly imagine a more foolish move than Joe Biden withholding weapons from one of our closest allies. And it comes after more and more Democrats have turned on Israel."" And she said ""Joe Biden’s legacy is already clear. He will go down in history as the commander in chief who refused to stop our enemies.""

It's another potential general election problem for Trump, who is currently making history as the first former or current president to stand trial in a criminal case. ""It might just be that Republicans want one last chance to express their dissatisfaction with the nominee and they’ll come home,"" Kochel, who remained neutral in the 2024 GOP nomination race, said.&nbsp; ""But if I’m running the Trump campaign, particularly as I look toward the vice presidential nomination, I would be trying to figure out any way I could to reassure the Haley voters that we’re going to listen to them and not just run a base only strategy,"" he suggested.  Biden also saw a red flag in Tuesday's primaries, as just over 10% of votes in the Democratic presidential contest in Maryland were ""uncommitted,"" according to unofficial and incomplete tabulations. It's the latest example of far left voters expressing their dissatisfaction with the president's Mideast policies.

And she was the final rival to Trump, battling the former president in a two-candidate showdown from the New Hampshire primary in late January through Super Tuesday in early March. Haley announced she was suspending her White House campaign March 6, the day after Trump swept 14 of 15 GOP nominating contests on Super Tuesday. WHAT KIND OF FUTURE DOES HALEY HAVE IN A TRUMP DOMINATED GOP? However, Haley made it clear when she exited the Republican presidential nomination race she intends to keep speaking out. ""While I will no longer be a candidate, I will not stop using my voice for the things I believe in,"" she emphasized as she spoke at her presidential campaign headquarters on Daniel Island in her hometown of Charleston. To date, Haley has declined to endorse Trump.  ""It is now up to Donald Trump to earn the votes of those in our party and beyond it who did not support him. And I hope he does that,"" Haley said in March, as she pointed to those who supported her during her White House run. Haley has not spoken with Trump since exiting the race, the source in her orbit confirmed to Fox News. Some top members of Haley's campaign, including some from the fundraising team, are expected to attend next week's gathering. Haley and groups aligned with her campaign hauled in over $160 million from nearly 300,000 donors.&nbsp; HALEY ENDS HER WHITE HOUSE BID BUT DECLINES TO ENDORSE TRUMP In a sign of potential trouble for Trump in his general election rematch with President Biden later this year, Haley continues to grab votes in the Republican primaries even though she's long gone from the presidential nomination race. Haley won nearly 22% of the vote in Tuesday's GOP presidential primary in Indiana, which was open to not only Republicans but also independents and Democrats.  Last month, Haley joined the Washington, D.C.-based Hudson Institute, a research organization focused on foreign and domestic policy, national security, economics and international relations. ""Nikki is a proven, effective leader on both foreign and domestic policy,"" Hudson President and CEO John P. Walters said in an announcement. ""In an era of worldwide political upheaval, she has remained a steadfast defender of freedom and an effective advocate for American security and prosperity. We are honored to have her join the Hudson team."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP During her White House bid, Haley advocated a muscular U.S. foreign policy to deal with global hot spots such as the war between Russia and Ukraine and the fighting between Israel and Hamas, often offering a stark contrast with Trump's America First agenda of keeping the nation out of international entanglements. Haley traded fire over America's overseas role with rival Vivek Ramaswamy, an advocate of Trump's America First philosophy, during the GOP presidential primary debates.

Senator's fundraising skill could be winning ticket for Trump's veepstakes,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senators-fundraising-skill-could-be-winning-ticket-for-trumps-veepstakes,Senator's fundraising skill could be winning ticket for Trump's veepstakes,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — As he helps raise money for former President Trump, Sen. Tim Scott says he's got a message that he's emphasizing as he meets with top Republican donors. ""It is in the best interest of the United States of America to have four more years of President Donald Trump. It is in the best interest of our economy to have four more years of Donald Trump,"" Scott said in an interview with Fox News Digital. Scott, who was one of roughly a dozen Republican candidates who unsuccessfully challenged Trump for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination before ending his White House bid late last year, endorsed the former president in January. The conservative senator from South Carolina over the past few months has become a top Trump surrogate and is considered to be among a small group of contenders being considered as Trump's running mate on the 2024 Republican ticket. TRUMP, RNC TOUT APRIL HAUL AS THEY TRY TO CLOSE FUNDRAISING GAP WITH BIDEN, DEMOCRATS  Scott has been meeting with donors as Trump and the Republican National Committee try to close the large fundraising gap they face in the race against President Biden and the Democratic National Committee in the 2024 rematch between the president and his GOP predecessor. ""The one thing you can discern as a top donor and Republican and, frankly, a strong business person is that a strong economy makes all things possible,"" Scott said in an interview Wednesday on Capitol Hill. VP STAKES: TRUMP MEETS WITH POTENTIAL RUNNING MATES Scott, the only Black Republican in the Senate, has been very active in helping Trump raise money. He was among the potential Trump running mates on hand this past weekend at an RNC spring donor retreat that was headlined by the former president. The senator helped organize a major fundraiser for Trump this year ahead of the South Carolina primary. Next week, he's scheduled to attend a top-dollar fundraiser in New York City for the former president. And as the New York Times first reported, Scott will host a gathering next month in the nation's capital that will include major GOP donors who remain uncommitted to Trump.  ""What I’m going to say to the donors across the country and specifically next week is that four more years under Donald Trump is good for our economy. It’s good for your pocket book. But more important, it’s good for America’s future."" Scott was a voracious fundraiser as he cruised to a very comfortable 2022 Senate re-election, and he transferred much of his unused campaign cash over to his 2024 White House effort. Asked if his fundraising efforts on behalf of Trump give him a leg up in the competition for the vice presidential nomination, Scott kept on message, saying, ""I certainly hope that all of our efforts will lead to a better America with one result: Donald Trump having four more years."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As for any competition between him and the other potential contenders, Scott would only say that ""my goal isn’t to be in a better position than someone else who wants something. My goal is to make sure that the next generation of leaders looks at me and others and says, ‘Those guys, they burned a path that we get to walk down.'"" Scott was interviewed the day after Indiana's Republican presidential primary, where former Ambassador to the United Nations and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley won over 21% of the vote against Trump, even though she ended her White House bid two months ago.  Haley, who was the last candidate standing against Trump before dropping out in March, has not endorsed the former president. Asked if he had reached out to his fellow South Carolinian in an attempt to mend relations with Trump's political orbit, the senator said no. But Scott argued that ""the good news is that the voters and the fundraising machine that supported [Haley's] candidacy and our candidacy and other candidates are all coming back into the fold. The good news is President Trump is a unifying force for our party.""

"With DNC nomination set for after Ohio deadline, legislators negotiate to ensure Biden is on ballot",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dnc-nomination-set-after-ohio-deadline-legislators-negotiate-ensure-biden-ballot,"With DNC nomination set for after Ohio deadline, legislators negotiate to ensure Biden is on ballot","Republican legislative leaders in Ohio say they are negotiating with Democrats to assure President Joe Biden appears on the state's November ballot, but the exact shape of the solution remains murky. GOP Ohio Senate President Matt Huffman told reporters Wednesday that productive discussions are under way between both legislative chambers and both political parties about how to fix the fact that the Democratic National Convention, where Biden is to be formally nominated, falls after Ohio's ballot deadline of Aug. 7. The convention will be held Aug. 19-22 in Chicago. ""Certainly, it's something that's going to happen. We need to take care of it,"" Huffman said, seeming to adjust his earlier stance that it was ""a Democratic problem"" that was up to the General Assembly's minority party to work out. He said the answer may be added to an existing bill or it could be contained in a stand-alone measure. VULNERABLE DEM SENATOR RIPPED FOR IGNORING QUESTIONS ABOUT BIDEN'S PUSH TO 'BAN' GAS-POWERED CARS On Tuesday, Republican House Speaker Jason Stephens expressed support for doing something to fix the problem with Ohio's deadline not just for this election cycle, but on a longer term basis.  Since Ohio changed its certification deadline from 60 to 90 days ahead of its general election, state lawmakers have had to adjust the requirement twice, in 2012 and 2020, to accommodate candidates of both parties. Each change was only temporary. Huffman said he also favors a more permanent solution. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Senate Democratic Leader Nickie Antonio continued to express confidence Wednesday that Biden will make Ohio's ballot, saying that ""all options are being explored."" ""The discussion is there, and it will become reality when we see it,"" she said. Antonio said a proxy war between Huffman and Stephens for next session's speakership is ""the elephant in the room"" that may be causing delays. As Ohio nears the May 9 cutoff set by Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, legislation meant to ensure Biden will appear on fall ballots in Alabama cleared the state's Senate Tuesday.

"Exit polls 'bogus, 'deliberate attempt' to justify rigging: Congress",https://www.thehindu.com/elections/lok-sabha/exit-polls-bogus-deliberate-attempt-to-justify-rigging-cong/article68242731.ece,Congress holds an online interaction with State unit chiefs to share their assessment of their respective States.,"A day after all major exit polls gave a clear majority to the BJP-led NDA for a third term, Opposition leaders rejected the predictions outright. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi called it a “Modi media poll.” “This is Modi ji’s poll, a fantasy poll,” Mr. Gandhi said on Sunday, adding that the Opposition bloc will get 295 of the 543 seats in the Lok Sabha. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamta Banerjee, whose party, the Trinamool Congress, is shown as getting fewer seats than the BJP in West Bengal, alleged that “the exit polls were prepared by the BJP two months ago.” “These exit polls have been prepared by the BJP and then given to the media. I am clearly telling you that they have no value. They are fake,” Ms. Banerjee told a channel. Her party shared the statement on its official X handle. She, however, neither endorsed the 295-figure provided by INDIA bloc leaders nor did she give a number for her party in West Bengal. But in an unusual pushback to the exit polls, the Congress invited the media to an online interaction that the party’s communication chief, Jairam Ramesh, had with Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) chiefs. The PCC presidents shared their assessments of the polls in their respective States. Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister D K Shivakumar said his party would win at least two-thirds of the 28 seats; Leader of the Opposition in the Punjab Assembly Partap Singh Bajwa said all the surveys have given 7-9 seats to the Congress; and Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu said the Congress has an edge in two parliamentary seats and is in a tight contest for the two other seats. Mr. Sukhu was also confident that the Congress would win the six Assembly seats where by-elections have taken place. Assam Congress chief Bhupen Borah claimed that his party would win at least half of the 14 Lok Sabha seats in the state. Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole, Haryana state unit chief Udai Bhan, Rajasthan Congress chief Govind Singh Dotasra and Uttar Pradesh Congress chief Ajai Rai also exuded confidence in performing much better than exit poll projections. Mr. Ramesh claimed the Prime Minister and Home Minister were playing mind games, but the INDIA bloc would win. “These are bogus polls, and psychological games are being played. Pressure is being applied by the outgoing PM and HM on the Opposition parties, the Election Commission, and counting agents to create an atmosphere that they are coming back. The reality is the exact opposite, he said. His colleague Pawan Khera noted, “If you want to make some extra money on the Satta market or influence the stock markets on Monday for the sake of your friends, it’s okay. But if you have a larger conspiracy and you are trying to legitimise that conspiracy through these figures, then the country is watching you.” Earlier in the day, party president Mallikarjun Kharge, general secretary (organisation) K.C. Venugopal, and Mr. Gandhi connected with the party’s Lok Sabha candidates on Zoom to discuss counting on June 4. They asked them to be extra vigilant. “All the candidates have been given a checklist as it is important to have a free and fair counting process,”Mr. Ramesh said. Indian National Congress

All four women candidates of BJP win in Arunachal polls,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/arunachal-pradesh-assembly/all-four-women-candidates-of-bjp-win-in-arunachal-polls/article68243388.ece,The BJP returned to power in Arunachal Pradesh by securing 46 seats in 60-member Assembly,"All four women candidates fielded by the BJP in the Arunachal Pradesh assembly elections have registered victories. In all, eight women candidates were in the fray in the assembly polls. Of them, four were fielded by the BJP, three by the Congress and one was an Independent nominee. Former chief minister Kalikho Pul's widow Dasanglu Pul won the Hayuliang seat in Anjaw district unopposed. This was the third time in a row that she won from the constituency. Ms. Pul had first won the by-election from the constituency in 2016 after her husband died by suicide on August 9 that year. She had also won the seat in 2019. Tsering Lhamu, the widow of former lawmaker Jambey Tashi, won Lumla seat by a margin of 1,531 votes. Earlier, she had won the by-election to the constituency in February last year, after her husband's death on November 2, 2022 due to cardiac arrest. Another BJP nominee, Chakat Aboh, won Khonsa West seat by a margin of 804 votes. Aboh had first won the seat in a by-election in 2019 after her husband Tirong Aboh of the NPP was assassinated by NSCN militants on May 21 that year, a day before the declaration of results. Nyabi Jini Dirchi, a greenhorn, has this time defeated sitting MLA Gokar Basar in Basar constituency by a margin of 1,791 votes.

BJP poised to get third term; both BJP and Congress may register small gains in vote share,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/lok-sabha/bjp-poised-to-get-third-term-both-bjp-and-congress-may-register-small-gains-in-vote-share/article68243852.ece,"For the Congress, its gains are likely to be rather chaotically spread across a few States, perhaps not enough for the party to make an impressive gain in terms of seats","In continuation of the reports by Lokniti-CSDS in this paper (The Hindu, April 11-13) the BJP seems to have held on its core bastions and warded off the challenge elsewhere. This is the most dominant trend picked up by Lokniti’s post-election survey conducted by visiting the homes of nearly 20,000 respondents selected through systematic random sampling. As we await the actual counting of votes on Tuesday, Lokniti’s post-election survey (see box for details) confirms the comfortable edge that the BJP enjoys in the 18th parliamentary election, and is set to form the government for a third term in a row. The Lokniti Team will bring out systematic analyses of various factors that may have contributed to this trend. Our survey suggests that both BJP and Congress will add a little bit to their respective vote shares from the previous election (37.4% and 19.5%, respectively) to poll 40% and 23%, respectively. A note of caution is in order here. While the gains for both Congress and BJP are in the range of 3% to 4%, the margin of error for this calculation of vote shares is ±3.08. Even as the BJP holds an edge in terms of vote share and is likely to add to its vote share by around three percentage points over the last election, the Congress too, will refuse to recede. An equal increase of about three per cent votes will ensure that the Congress as a party will remain in the reckoning, although as a distant second. Thus, though the Congress may gain votes compared to its debacle in 2014, that gain might not be sufficient to shake the BJP. This fact, and the spatial spread of votes, will determine the seat shares of these parties. A limited but significant accretion to the vote shares of both parties hints at the attrition of some of the smaller parties. Also read: Lokniti CSDS pre-poll survey for 2024 Lok Sabha elections: a package The BJP made every effort this time to make an impact in both States of the east, and of the south. These efforts are likely to pay off with BJP’s vote in these regions increasing compared with last time. On the other hand, for the Congress, its gains are likely to be rather chaotically spread across a few States, perhaps not enough for the party to make an impressive gain in terms of seats. This asymmetry of performance is likely to help the BJP and disappoint the Congress. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is Congress’ ally only in Gujarat, Haryana and Delhi; and the Trinamool Congress (TMC) only in Uttar Pradesh. Also Read : CSDS-Lokniti 2024 pre-poll survey | Key decisions and political implication for BJP Ever since the BJP re-emerged as a dominant player, the fate of State parties has been hanging in balance. But the compulsions of the Congress to enter into alliances in most States, and the corresponding caution taken by the BJP to fortify the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), has ensured that for the State parties, the outcome tomorrow will be a temporary breather. Many State parties will be poised to play an important part, either in the ruling coalition or in the Opposition coalition. These, of course, are the trends from the survey. On Tuesday, we shall get to know the picture emerging from actual count of millions of votes cast over the past seven weeks. That will be followed by Lokniti’s analysis of how that outcome was shaped. Also read: Exit poll 2024 highlights The Lokniti programme of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), Delhi conducted a nationwide post-poll survey. The fieldwork for the post-poll survey was conducted in 23 States after each phase of voting. The fieldwork began from April 20, 2024 and will go on till June 3, 2024. So far, 18,014 voters have been interviewed (the data for the last phase will be added after the completion of the fieldwork on June 3) in 191 parliamentary constituencies spread across 772 polling stations in 23 States. The respondents randomly selected from the electoral rolls were approached by trained field investigators for an interview at their place of residence after votes had been cast in their respective constituencies.

The BJP bagged 46 of the 60 seats in the Arunachal Pradesh Assembly. The party had approached the April 19 election with 10 seats won uncontested, as no other party fielded candidates against Chief Minister Pema Khandu in the Mukto constituency, his deputy Chowna Mein in Chowkham, as well as eight others. In Sikkim, the SKM won an unprecedented 31 of the 32 seats in the State Assembly, with Chief Minister Prem Singh Tamang bagging two of them – Rhenock and Soreng-Chakung. The lone winner for the Sikkim Democratic Front (SDF), Tenzing Norbu Lamtha, had switched over from the SKM ahead of the Assembly election after being denied a ticket. The SKM was a constituent of the BJP-helmed National Democratic Alliance, but the two parties had ended their partnership ahead of the April 19 election. “We are grateful to the people of Arunachal Pradesh, who voted for the developmental works under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” Mr. Khandu said, after his party won five seats more than it had done in 2019. Political observers said that Sunday’s outcome followed a pattern: the party that rules the State and at the Centre usually wins elections in Arunachal Pradesh. While the BJP did not face any anti-incumbency, it was also better organised at the grass-roots level, and faced hardly any opposition. The Congress, which had ruled the State for more than 30 years, only managed to field candidates for 19 of the 34 seats it had intended to contest. The National People’s Party (NPP), otherwise an NDA constituent, contested 20 seats, the most after the 60 fielded by the BJP. While the NPP won five seats –the same as in 2019 – it was only former Minister Kumar Waii who saved the Congress from a complete rout by winning the Bameng seat. The Congress had won four seats five years ago. The remaining seats were divided among the Nationalist Congress Party (three), the regional People’s Party of Arunachal (two) and Independents (three). Among the major losers was 77-year-old Gegong Apang, who had been Chief Minister of Arunachal Pradesh for more than 22 years. He had floated the Arunachal Democratic Front ahead of the election in a bid to revive his political career. The Sikkim election was expected to be a close contest between the SKM and the SDF. Instead, it turned out to be an almost complete sweep in favour of the SKM. Sikkim Chief Minister and Sikkim Krantikari Morcha (SKM) chief Prem Singh Tamang speaks with the media after party’s victory in the State Assembly elections, in Gangtok, on June 2, 2024.

PTI Voters in the Himalayan State have been giving a second chance to regional parties since the 287-day President’s Rule in 1985. The trend began with Nar Bahadur Bhandari’s Sikkim Sangram Parishad, continued with the SDF, and now the SKM. Apart from indicating that voters had little or no complaints against the SKM, the outcome underlined the individual-driven politics in Sikkim. “Mr. Tamang has been a popular leader, particularly because of several pro-poor schemes and government jobs given to some 25,000 youths – a big thing for a State with 4.6 lakh voters – ahead of the polls,” Amit Patro, the editor of Sikkim Express, told The Hindu. The SDF had accused the SKM of large-scale corruption but the ruling party turned the tables after the glacial lake outburst disaster in October 2023, pointing out how the SDF’s Chamling government had put the people’s lives at risk with sub-standard hydropower projects. Mr. Tamang is also believed to have struck a chord with the voters by denying a party ticket to his son Aditya Tamang from the Soreng-Chakung seat, although his wife contested and won the Namchi-Singhithang constituency. “Our party worked very hard but this victory is because of the love and trust of the people we earned in the past five years. We have the next five years to give our 100 per cent for the people of Sikkim,” he said, at a gathering in Gangtok’s Paljor Stadium to celebrate the party’s victory. Sikkim’s 2024 mandate could be the end of the road for the 73-year-old former Chief Minister and SDF’s founder-president Pawan Kumar Chamling, who lost comprehensively from two seats – Namcheybung and Poklok-Kamrang. Former ace footballer Bhaichung Bhutia, who merged his Hamro Sikkim Party with the SDF in 2023, lost the Barfung seat, his sixth electoral defeat since contesting on a Trinamool Congress ticket in 2014. The BJP, which had 10 MLAs even without contesting the 2019 election, and the newly-floated and crowdfunded Citizen Action Party, both came a cropper too. The BJP was believed to have been done in by the fears that its victory would lead to the dilution of Article 371F that guarantees special status for Sikkim. The fear was triggered by the expansion of the definition of ‘Sikkimese’ beyond the indigenous Bhutia, Lepcha, and Nepali people, in the Finance Act, 2023. Bharatiya Janata Party

Taking stock of the counting arrangements through a video-conference with the DEOs on Sunday, Mr. Meena said police should be on a high alert keeping in view the likelihood of violence as the electoral contest was bitterly fought by the parties and the outcomes could be heartbreaking for some. The counting of votes should, under no circumstances, be affected by the reactions of candidates and their followers who could create a charged atmosphere, he said. Mr. Meena told the DEOs and other officials concerned to seal the EVMs immediately after the completion of counting and safeguard them properly, and to ensure that Forms 21-C and 21-E related to the declaration of results reached the Election Commission of India (ECI) on June 5 without fail. Besides, the index cards should be submitted at the office of the CEO before June 8, he said. Further, the CEO said political parties should be allowed to post counting agents at the Returning Officers’ tables only in the absence of candidates. Agents could be kept to watch at every counting table. The counting agents were supposed to carry only Forms-17-C and the required stationery. Additional CEOs P. Koteswara Rao and M.N. Harendhira Prasad, Joint CEO A. Venkateshwar Rao and others participated. General Elections 2024

For a consensus: On campaigning rhetoric and foreign policy,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/for-a-consensus-the-hindu-editorial-on-campaigning-rhetoric-and-foreign-policy/article68242810.ece,Elections should not prompt politicians to break the consensus on foreign policy,"With the curtains coming down on the general election 2024, every party will take stock of its campaign on issues of domestic political importance. However, it is also necessary for all concerned, particularly those forming the next government, to review the disturbing trend of revisiting questions of foreign policy. Both sides have ratcheted up the rhetoric over India’s international ties and in some cases, even the re-opening of settled bilateral agreements. At the start of the campaign, the ruling party focused on the issue of the half-century-old Katchatheevu agreement, that accepted the island as Sri Lankan territory, to target the Opposition Congress and the DMK that were in power in 1974. In response, Congress leaders asked whether the 2015 Land Boundary Agreement with Bangladesh could also be reviewed for its land concessions. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has led the charge on other foreign policy fronts, especially on Pakistan, calling the Congress party a “disciple of Pakistan” and comparing its manifesto pejoratively to that of the Muslim League that founded Pakistan. U.P. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath even proclaimed that were Mr. Modi to be re-elected, he would reclaim Pakistan Occupied Kashmir “within six months”. Other brash comments over India’s use of its nuclear arsenal, or that the government will transgress international boundaries to kill ‘terrorists threatening India’, have raised eyebrows in many capitals. The clashes between the Indian Army and Chinese PLA at Galwan in 2020 that led to the deaths of 20 soldiers have often been raised by Opposition leaders in campaign rallies, as in the past as well. Meanwhile, throughout the campaign, Mr. Modi and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar accused “western powers” of attempting to interfere in Indian polls. Such heated campaign rhetoric is meant for domestic audiences, but it would be unwise for political leaders to assume that India’s international partners are not watching and listening carefully. India’s ties with its smaller neighbours carry the highest levels of sensitivity, and raking up these issues and exposing India’s vulnerable faultlines, just to make political capital, seems short-sighted. While domestic policy has always been deeply divisive, India’s polity had for long achieved a bipartisanship when it came to foreign policy positions, and often took pride in the deployment of Opposition leaders to defend India’s case worldwide, including at the UN. The proper platform for the government to assert foreign policy, or for the Opposition to air its differences with it, is not the hustings, but Parliament. It is hoped that as the dust settles, leaders will reflect on the potential damage to India’s credibility from campaign propaganda, and restore a more enduring consensus on international relations.

Turnout conundrum: On stocktaking on voter participation,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/turnout-conundrum-on-stocktaking-on-voter-participation/article68225340.ece,The low voting percentage in many States is a cause for concern,"With just one phase left in the general election 2024, a stocktaking exercise on voter participation across the country reveals a significant dampening in turnout in this set of elections in comparison to the 2019 and even the 2014 general elections. There are State and regional level variations — voters in the east, northeast and many in the south typically voted higher than those in west, central and north India. Yet, barring some exceptions such as Telangana and Karnataka, where voter turnout registered a small increase from 62.8% to 65.7% and 68.8% to 70.6% among others, there has been a general decline in voting across States in 2024. As an analysis in The Hindu revealed, not only was there a dip in turnout in percentage terms, but there was also a decline in voter turnout in absolute terms in 132 of the 485 constituencies that went to polls in the first six phases. The high number of seats that encountered a dip in voter participation is unprecedented since the latest delimitation that was conducted prior to the 2009 general election. A closer look at the numbers shows that there was a significant bump in the total electorate (eligible voters above the age of 18 years) in 2014, and slight increases in 2019 and 2024. But it was only in 2024 that voter turnout dropped dramatically in many constituencies. This drop in turnout can possibly be explained by political factors. Was there lower enthusiasm to vote in States which did not feature a strong contest among the parties in the fray? Does this explain the relatively low turnout in Gujarat (60.1%, a 4.4 point drop from 2019), where the Bharatiya Janata Party is in a dominant position or Kerala (71.3%, 6.6 point drop) where both the main rivals, the Left and the Congress along with their allies, are part of the INDIA bloc nationally? Has inter-State migration been a factor which possibly explains the low turnout in the northern and central States? Bihar, for example, has seen a significant gender gap, with women voters far outnumbering men in participation in percentage terms. Have the heatwave conditions contributed to electors deciding to stay at home? These are questions that deserve a closer look at data and the Election Commission of India must play a role in answering some of them. India has always enjoyed a higher degree of participation relative to other electoral democracies and a significant drop, as seen this year, is cause for concern. Voter apathy over the longer term can undermine the democratic process itself. People get the government they deserve when they vote, and the government they do not deserve when they do not vote.

Absolute numbers: On the ECI and faith in the process,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/absolute-numbers-the-hindu-editorial-on-the-eci-and-faith-in-the-process/article68217858.ece,The ECI should do everything to reinforce people’s faith in the democratic process,"A total of 58 Lok Sabha seats in eight States and Union Territories voted on Saturday in the sixth and penultimate phase of the general election 2024. With this, polling has been completed in 28 States and Union Territories, in 486 constituencies. Voting is also over for 105 Assembly constituencies of Odisha. The last phase of polling will be on June 1 for the remaining 57 seats and counting of votes will take place on June 4. Sporadic incidents of violence were reported from West Bengal which also reported the highest polling percentage at 79.47. In Jammu and Kashmir, the Anantnag-Rajouri seat recorded a turnout of 54.30%, an impressive high. Urban apathy continued in the seven seats of Delhi which went to the polls with just 57.67% of the electorate turning out to vote. The searing heat wave prevailing in north India did not help matters. The Election Commission of India (ECI) released, for the first time in this general election, the absolute number of votes cast in each constituency for the first five phases. The ECI came out with the data a day after the Supreme Court of India refused to direct the commission to disclose details of Form 17C, which contains this data at the booth level and is handed out to all the polling agents of the candidates. The ECI has alleged, inappropriately, there to be a “pattern of false narratives and mischievous design to vitiate electoral process”. It is true that concerns have been raised by several actors about the electoral process, and it is possible that a part of it could be due to ignorance or even out of mischief. A mature and appropriate response expected of the body that is tasked with overseeing the largest democratic exercise on the planet is to provide information to the public that removes such concerns. The commission opposed the disclosure of Form 17C in the Supreme Court — all the while insinuating at a conspiracy to vitiate the electoral process. Complaints brought to its attention by anyone should be addressed in a manner that behoves a robust democracy. It is indeed the duty of the ECI to ensure that the electoral process is not vitiated, and the best way to achieve it is to ensure the maximum transparency that is administratively possible. The ECI has done well by publishing the data on the absolute number of voters, and it could proactively look for more measures that could reinforce public faith in the process and in its own integrity.

Welcome bounty: On the RBI’s ₹2.11-lakh-crore transfer to the Union government,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/welcome-bounty-on-the-rbis-transfer-to-the-union-government/article68212198.ece,The RBI’s transfer of surplus should help next government start confidently,"The decision by the Reserve Bank of India’s board to transfer a record surplus of almost ₹2.11 lakh crore to the Union government for 2023-24 will serve as a welcome shot in the arm for the new government when it presents its Budget in July. More than double the previous year’s ₹87,416 crore payout as well as the ₹1.02 lakh crore dividend-cum-surplus receipts from the banking and financial system and RBI that was pencilled into the interim Union Budget for 2024-25, the transfer should give the next Finance Minister a fair bit of elbow room when computing the spending and fiscal math. The surge in transferable surplus reflects the prudent asset management approach adopted by the Indian central bank, at a time of lingering global uncertainty and widespread policy tightening by central banks worldwide seeking to restore price stability. While the specifics of the RBI’s 2023-24 balance sheet will be known in the coming days, clearly a combination of substantial gains from higher interest income earned on its holdings of overseas securities and the gains from its interventions in the foreign exchange market to smoothen volatility in the rupee’s moves must have contributed in swelling the surplus. The weekly statistical supplement shows that as on March 29, total foreign exchange reserves had increased by $67.1 billion over the course of 12 months to $645.58 billion. The RBI’s prudence has also extended to the crucial provisioning done under the Contingent Risk Buffer (CRB), where it has raised the level of funds set aside to cover for any unforeseen contingencies and risks to the economy. By raising the level of provisioning by 50 basis points to 6.5% of its balance sheet size for 2023-24, the central bank has clearly signalled its increased confidence in the health of the domestic economy even as it strengthens the buffer against any sudden threats to stability from unexpected developments in the global financial system. For the new government that will assume office after the results of the ongoing general election are declared on June 4, the bountiful surplus transfer from the RBI will give it an opportunity to raise capital spending, especially at a time when the key engine of private consumption expenditure is still in search of sustained tailwinds. The opportunity to use some of the additional bonanza to bridge the fiscal gap can also help strengthen the government’s finances and reassure investors of its commitment to the fiscal consolidation road map. The RBI has in its own quiet way paved the path for the next government to start with confidence in the resilience of the economy. Reserve Bank of India

Setting the bar: On the Election Commission of India,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/setting-the-bar-on-the-election-commission-of-india/article68204217.ece,The poll panel is too important an institution to be left to its own devices,"The Election Commission of India (ECI) asking the BJP and the Congress to desist from raising divisive issues in campaigning in the general election is a case of better late than never. The ECI has, in recent years, disappointed the Indian electorate by its inability to be effective, impartial and prompt in its role as the watchdog of elections. This is partly a function of the mechanism of the appointment of the ECI’s members, which is entirely a partisan decision of the executive. The ECI has now written to BJP president J.P. Nadda to ask “star campaigners” of the party to refrain from making statements which “may divide the society”. Its letter follows his response on May 13 to a notice issued to him over a complaint against Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech in Banswara, Rajasthan — Mr. Modi had referred to Muslims as “infiltrators” and “people with more children.” The letter to Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge asks him to ensure that the party’s star campaigners desist from making any statements which may cause tensions between different castes and communities. These rebukes from the ECI to the parties come a day after it censured the former Calcutta High Court judge turned BJP candidate from Tamluk, West Bengal, Abhijit Gangopadhyay, for his remarks against Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee. He was barred from campaigning for 24 hours. Earlier, the ECI had acted against YSRCP chief, Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, BRS chief K. Chandrashekar Rao, Telangana Minister Konda Surekha, BJP leaders Shobha Karandlaje and Dilip Ghosh, and Congress leaders Supriya Shrinate and Randeep Surjewala. Complaints against U.P. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, last week, for their alleged violation of the model code of conduct (MCC) are pending. Overall, these measures might give an appearance of impartiality but that is not enough. The ECI is assuming a false parity between legitimate debates on policies that impact various social groups differently and an incitement of xenophobia for social polarisation. The MCC cannot be a ruse to muffle political debates and disagreements which are, and should be, at the heart of campaigning. Misuse of power and creation of disharmony fall in a different basket. The integrity and the credibility of the ECI is central to the legitimacy of elections. Reinforcing its independence should be a priority for all stakeholders in Indian democracy, particularly political parties and the judiciary. The ECI is too important to be left to itself.

Vote for a change: On the voter in Kashmir,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/vote-for-a-change-on-the-voter-in-kashmir/article68200791.ece,Kashmiris have sought to use the ballot box to seek change from the status quo,"The voter turnout in the Srinagar and Baramulla constituencies in the Kashmir valley — Anantnag-Rajouri is to vote on May 25 after the Election Commission of India postponed the election — is well below the national average. While Srinagar registered only 38.5%, preliminary figures from Baramulla indicate a turnout of 59.1%. The national average for the first four phases was 66.95% and 61.61% in the fifth phase, according to early trends. Yet, these numbers in the Valley are salubrious compared to the past — 13% in Srinagar and 34.6% in Baramulla in 2019. Baramulla registered its highest turnout since 1984 (61.1% participation). In the last six years, the elected Assembly was dissolved, the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir bifurcated into two Union Territories, the special status of the province abrogated by the BJP-led Union government, and the Valley subjected to months of Internet shutdowns. Scores of politicians were also arrested. Kashmir still remains India’s most securitised region with recurring militant violence. While local body elections have been held since then, the general election is the first major poll with significant contestation involving the Valley’s mainstream polity. Should the increase in turnout be read as a significant reduction in the alienation of the Kashmiri people? The answer is not unambiguous. A substantive section of the voters who turned out have sought a change in the status quo. The limitations on political activity in the Valley since 2018 have constrained citizens who have had little recourse to airing their grievances due to the absence of legislative representation in the Assembly. Thus, livelihood concerns have not been sufficiently addressed, and the greater electoral participation now reflects the need for representation of the electorate’s voices. Union Home Minister Amit Shah has stated that the higher polling in these two constituencies is the “greatest testament to rightness” of abrogating the special status that was enshrined in Article 370 — a statement devoid of reason. A truer reflection of the support for the abrogation would have been a favourable mandate for parties endorsing the move, but the BJP did not even field candidates in the Valley. It is clear that it saw the writing on the wall in terms of how it was perceived in the region. Mr. Shah and the BJP should not misinterpret the reasons for the increase in voter participation. The voices in the Valley have given way to some using the ballot box as a medium to get the region out of its political morass. The Indian state must listen and make amends. voting

The Jagannath Temple Ratna Bhandar ‘missing keys’ controversy: Explained,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/lok-sabha/jagannath-temples-ratna-bhandar-missing-keys-controversy-explained/article68231728.ece,A six year old issue about the ‘missing keys’ of the Jagannath Puri temple’s ‘Ratna Bhandar’ has become the focal point of BJP’s poll campaign this year in Odisha. Here’s a look at the issue and the ruling BJD’s response to it.,"The story so far:  Eager to stop Naveen Patnaik from winning a historic sixth term in Odisha, the BJP has launched sharp attack with the State’s most prominent religious controversy — the missing keys of Jagannath temple’s ‘Ratna Bhandar.’ Led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the BJP has accused Patnaik’s government of ‘sending the keys to Tamil Nadu’ — an indirect dig at Patnaik’s close aide V.K. Pandian. Addressing a public meeting in Cuttack on May 20, Mr. Modi said, “Even Jagannath Mandir is not safe under BJD rule. For the past six years, the keys of Shri Jagannatha’s ‘Ratna Bhandar’ has been missing. Leaders of BJD are involved in this conspiracy.” Taking a dig at Mr. Pandian, a Tamil Nadu-born former bureaucrat, he claimed that “there were discussions as to how the keys had gone to Tamil Nadu,” vowing to probe this if the BJP is voted to power. The ‘missing keys’ issue has also been raised by other BJP leaders like Union Ministers Amit Shah, Smriti Irani and Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, echoing Mr. Modi’s accusation against Mr. Pandian. Odisha is currently polling in four phases simultaneously for 147 Assembly seats and 21 Lok Sabha seats.

ANI Mr. Pandian retorted in a statement to PTI on May 21. “The prime minister should find out where the keys have gone if he has so much knowledge. He has so many authorities under him, he would be having some knowledge. He can enlighten the people of Odisha.” Here’s a look at the six-year controversy and why the BJP is raking it up again. The gold and jewels offered by devotees to the deities at the Puri Jagannath temple — Lord Jagannath, Lord Balabhadra and Goddess Subhadra — is stored in the Ratna Bhandar, located adjacent to the Jagamohan (prayer hall) at the north side of the temple. As per the Orissa Review, published by the State government, the Jagannath Temple Act, 1952 was passed to allow the State government to have a bigger say in the management, administration and governance of the temple. Under this law, a list of the ornaments and gold offered to the deities was prepared and preserved in the Record Room of the Puri collectorate. The Ratna Bhandar has two chambers: the ‘Bhitar Bhandar’ (Inner Treasury) and ‘Bahar Bhandar’ (Outer Treasury). As per the last inventory in 1978, the Bahar Bhandar stores 87 pieces of gold ornaments, some with precious stones, and 62 pieces of silver items. The Bhitar Bhandar has 367 gold items including ornaments studded with precious stones, plates of gold, pearls, diamonds, corals and other precious stones and 231 items of silver articles. The safety of the Ratna Bhandar vests with the Temple’s Managing Committee, which is headed by titular ‘King of Puri’ Dibyasingha Deb (Chairman), the Chief Administrator (sn IAS-level officer) and other members appointed or nominated by the State government. Sand art depicting the Ratna Bhandar by Sudarshan Patnaik The items in the Bhitar Bhandar are never used and are stored under a double lock, sealed by the Managing Committee, and the keys are generally deposited by the temple administration in the Government treasury. The locks may be opened only if ordered by the State government. However, items used for special occasions are stored under double lock in the Bahar Bhandar, which may be opened in the presence of temple officials and the Chief administrator from time to time. Items used daily are locked and under the protection of the Bhandar Mekap. The last two types of ornaments stored in the outer treasury are compared and verified periodically —at least once every six months. Initially, the Puri royal family, the temple committee and the Puri collectorate had copies of the keys to the Ratna Bhandar. In 1963, after losing a case challenging the State’s ownership of the temple, the royal family surrendered its copy to the State treasury. However, the other two copies remained with the temple committee and the Puri collectorate. The last time the Bhitar Bhandar was opened for taking stock of the inventory was in 1978, Law Minister Pratap Jena said during the 2018 Budget session of the Odisha Assembly. As per the inventory, gold items weighing 4364 bhari (50 kilograms) and 14,878 bhari (173 kilograms) of silver were stored in the inner treasury, apart from a sizeable amount of gold ornaments used regularly in temple rituals. It was once again opened in 1985 for maintenance work, but no inventory was conducted. Since then, the temple administration has tried to open the inner treasury twice but stopped short, fearing that the sentiments of devotees may be hurt. The last such attempt was made on April 4, 2018, when the temple administration wanted to open the inner treasury for inspection, but was unable to do so as the keys to the room could not be found. The 16-member team, which included three members of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), were forced to inspect the inner chamber from outside using search lights through a grill gate. The inspection was done as per the orders of the Orissa High Court, which was monitoring temple repairs undertaken by the ASI since 2016, and a report was submitted to the High Court in a sealed cover. The news first broke on June 1, 2018, when the Puri District Collector Arvind Agarwal, who was in-charge of the keys to the inner chamber, revealed at the temple managing committee meeting that there was no information confirming the availability of the keys. Amid an uproar from citizens, devotees and the Opposition (BJP and Congress), the Naveen Patnaik administration ordered a judicial inquiry into the issue on June 5, 2018. The inquiry commission, headed by retired High Court judge Justice Raghubir Das, submitted its 324-page report to the State government in November that year. As pressure mounted on the State government, the temple’s chief administrator P.K. Jena was shunted out. Within ten days of investigation, on June 13, the Puri district administration stumbled upon a brown sealed envelope allegedly containing the duplicate keys to the Bhitar Bhandar inside a locker in the district record room. These keys were deposited with the district treasury by Mr. Agrawal prior to his transfer in August that year. However, the Opposition and even the Puri Shankaracharya Swami Nischalananda Saraswati remained critical of the BJD government, blaming it for laxity, and demanded strict action against the guilty officials. Senior BJP leader Biswabhusan Harichandan (now the Governor of Chhattisgarh) claimed that there had been no record of the existence of duplicate keys to the inner chambers, demanding a definite answer from the Chief Minister in the Assembly, as reported by The Sunday Guardian on September 1, 2018. Raising concerns about the contents of the Bhitar Bhandar, Mr. Harichandan said, “Opening the treasury and preparing a fresh inventory should be the top priority of the State government.” Odisha Congress veteran Niranjan Patnaik too voiced the same demand. In April 2023, Dilip Kumar Baral, a Puri resident, filed a PIL in the Orissa High Court seeking the tabling of the judicial committee’s report on the missing keys probe in the State Assembly. According to Mr. Baral, the State government has reportedly spent around ₹23 lakh for the Commission of Inquiry, but had kept the findings secret from the public. The report which was submitted to the State government in 2018 is yet to revealed. Later that year, the Jagannath Temple Managing Committee adopted a resolution to open the Ratna Bhandar on August 4, allowing an ASI team to survey the chamber’s contents. However, the State government, which has the final say in opening the Bhitar Bhandar, is yet to take a call. The Odisha High Court has also adjourned the hearing in the case, allowing the State government additional time to file an update on the status on the probe. Both BJP and Congress have publicly protested against the BJD’s reluctance to open the inner treasury.

ANI “Resentment is brewing among devotees of Shree Jagannath Temple over non-opening of Ratna Bhandar. Devotees want to know if ornaments remained as safe as before,” claimed Sameer Mohanty, former BJP State president. The Odisha Congress also held a Tulasi Yatra (collection of holy basil) from locals in December 2023 to pressure the State government to open the Ratna Bhandar. The collected basil leaves were then offered at the temple by Congress leaders. In February 2024, as per the High Court’s orders, Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik formed a 12-member committee, headed by former Supreme Court Justice Arijit Pasayat, to oversee the inventory of jewellery and other precious stones kept in the Ratna Bhandar. Other members include cardiologist Ramakant Panda, Vidhu Bhushan Samal, the former Chairman and Managing Director of Allahabad Bank; the Temple Committee’s chairman Dibyasingh Deb and ASI representatives. However, the CM has not revealed when and if the missing keys probe report will be tabled or when the inner chamber will be opened. The Hindu Explains

Why did the Supreme Court not apply its Kejriwal bail precedent to Hemant Soren? | Explained,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/why-did-the-supreme-court-not-apply-its-kejriwal-bail-precedent-to-hemant-soren-explained/article68206893.ece,"While the top Court granted bail to Mr. Kejriwal to campaign for elections earlier this month, it refused to entertain Mr. Soren’s case. What was the Court’s reasoning? What lies ahead for the incarcerated Opposition leaders?","The story so far: The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to entertain a petition by former Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren seeking interim bail to campaign in the ongoing Lok Sabha elections by berating him for concealing key facts and engaging in ‘blemished conduct.’ Mr. Soren had also challenged the legality of his arrest by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on January 31 in a money laundering case related to an alleged land scam. The Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) leader had sought parity with Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who was given interim bail by the top Court on May 10 to canvass votes for the Aam Admi Party (AAP) in the polls. Voting will take place for the remaining seven seats of Jharkhand in the last two phases on May 25 and June 1. After a vacation Bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Satish Chandra Sharma expressed their inclination to record in the order that Mr. Soren had approached the Court with ‘unclean hands,’ Mr. Kapil Sibal, appearing for the former CM, decided to withdraw the petition. In light of this development, The Hindu decodes why the precedent of the Supreme Court granting interim relief to the AAP supremo was not relied upon in Mr. Soren’s case. Also Read: Hemant Soren hearing highlights May 22, 2024 Soon after the former Jharkhand Chief Minister’s arrest by the Enforcement Directorate on January 31, he moved the Supreme Court challenging the legality of this arrest. However, a three-judge bench comprising Justices Sanjiv Khanna, MM Sundresh and Bela M Trivedi refused to entertain the plea and asked him to try his luck in the Jharkhand High Court instead. The Bench, however, requested the High Court to consider and decide Mr. Soren’s petition expeditiously. The High Court heard Mr. Soren’s plea and reserved its verdict on February 28. However, it pronounced its judgment refusing to quash the case on May 3, nearly two months later. On April 24, the JMM leader filed a fresh petition in the top Court challenging his arrest, citing the delay by the High Court in pronouncing its verdict. On May 6, an appeal was also filed against the High Court’s order with a plea for an urgent hearing given the ongoing Lok Sabha polls. In the meantime, on March 30, the ED filed a chargesheet in the case attaching land worth ₹31 crore allegedly owned by the former CM. A special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court in Jharkhand took cognisance of it on April 4 — an indication that it had prima facie found incriminating material suggesting Mr. Soren had committed the offence. Only after this pre-trial stage can the trial Court frame charges, following which the trial would commence. While Mr. Soren’s plea challenging his arrest was pending before the High Court, he had moved a bail application under Section 45 of the PMLA before the Special Court which was eventually declined on May 3. However, during the proceedings, the Supreme Court took Mr. Soren to task for concealing the fact that the Special Court had already taken cognisance of the money laundering charges against him. It also expressed strong reservations about the former CM approaching the top Court for interim bail even while he was concurrently pursuing a ‘parallel remedy’ for bail from the trial Court. “His (Soren’s) conduct when he came to the Supreme Court is not without blemish… Why did you not disclose the cognisance order (of the Special Court) in the present petition?” Justice Datta asked Mr. Sibal. However, the senior lawyer maintained that the cognisance order had been filed as a part of additional documents submitted in an earlier litigation in the apex Court. While Mr. Sibal asserted that his client’s bona fides should not be questioned for any possible default on the part of his lawyers, the Bench pointed out that crucial facts about the trial Court’s cognisance order and subsequent bail order were missing not only from Mr. Soren’s present petition but also from the one filed previously against the High Court’s delay in pronouncing its verdict. Additional Solicitor General (ASG) SV Raju also chipped in to highlight that the former CM had failed to include the cognisance and rejection of bail orders in the “list of dates,” although these developments took place subsequent to the filing of the petition. While reiterating that there was no intention of “hoodwinking” the Court, Mr. Soren’s lawyer contended that a Special Court’s cognisance order does not affect a Constitutional Court’s power to strike down an ‘illegal’ arrest since personal liberty was at stake. Responding to this, the Bench underscored that if the former CM wanted to appeal to the judges’ conscience then he should have come with ‘clean hands.’ At this point, Mr. Sibal requested the Bench to let him withdraw the plea to abate the possibility of any adverse remarks being recorded against his client. The Court acceded to the request. The Delhi Chief Minister was arrested on March 21 by the ED in a money laundering case relating to the Delhi excise policy. The Delhi High Court on March 27 rejected his plea for interim bail and then proceeded to uphold his arrest on April 9. The very next day, Mr. Kejriwal challenged the High Court’s decision in the Supreme Court. Approaching the High Court instead of the trial Court appears to have been a crucial strategic move in the Kejriwal case. This is because obtaining bail in PMLA cases is highly unlikely due to the high threshold envisaged under Section 45 of the PMLA. The provision stipulates ‘twin conditions’ for bail — the accused has to first prove that he or she is prima facie innocent of the offence and secondly, the accused should be able to convince the judge that he or she is not likely to commit any offence while on bail. On the other hand, the standard is set differently when the legality of the arrest itself is challenged before a Constitutional Court, i.e., either before a High Court or a Supreme Court. Under Section 19 of the PMLA (power to arrest), the onus is on the ED to show that the concerned investigating officer had “reasons to believe” from “materials in possession” that the person intended to be arrested is “guilty of the offence.” This objective criteria has to be satisfied before going ahead with the arrest. While hearing Mr. Kejriwal’s appeal against the Delhi High Court’s refusal to quash his arrest, a Bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta made a surprise announcement on May 3 that they were considering interim bail for Mr. Kejriwal due to the ongoing polls. Accordingly, on May 10, the top Court granted the AAP supremo interim bail till June 1 to campaign for the Lok Sabha polls. While highlighting the “prodigious importance” of the polls, the judges acknowledged that Mr. Kejriwal’s status as the Chief Minister of Delhi and the leader of a national party justified the “holistic and libertarian view.” They, however, restrained Mr. Kejriwal from visiting the Office of the Chief Minister and the Delhi Secretariat as well as from signing official files to assert that ‘no special circumstances’ were being created for politicians. Unlike Mr. Soren, the Delhi CM had neither sought regular bail from a trial court nor had there been any judicial order of cognisance against him in the Delhi excise policy case. He had instead chosen to approach the Constitutional Courts to quash his arrest. On the other hand, the Jharkhand trial Court’s orders of cognisance and rejection of bail in Mr Soren’s case implied that it had prima facie found incriminating material to proceed with the case. Mr. Soren had not challenged the cognisance order. Further, the timing of Mr. Kejriwal’s arrest — days after the Model Code of Conduct for the Lok Sabha elections came into force— was repeatedly questioned by the top Court during the proceedings. The former Jharkhand CM, however, was arrested much earlier — in January this year. While the ED filed a chargesheet against Mr. Soren on March 30, Mr. Kejriwal was made an accused, along with AAP, in a supplementary chargesheet only after he was out on interim bail. The apex Court’s refusal to entertain Mr. Soren’s petition means that he will have to challenge the trial Court’s order dismissing his bail plea before the Jharkhand High Court. He will have to remain in judicial custody in the meantime. Mr. Kejriwal, on the other hand, will have to return to Tihar jail on June 2 once his interim bail tenure ends. The Supreme Court on May 17 reserved its verdict on his plea challenging the legality of his arrest, but the judgement in the case can only be pronounced once the Court reopens after vacation in July. The Delhi CM has, however, been granted liberty to approach a trial Court for bail in the interim period. The Hindu Explains

Why are concerns being raised over the Election Commission’s voter turnout data? | Explained,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/lok-sabha/concerns-over-the-election-commission-voter-turnout-data-lok-sabha-elections/article68195749.ece,"Alleging irregularities, Opposition leaders want the ECI to publish online ‘Form 17C data,’ which contains the absolute number of votes polled in a booth. How has the poll body responded and what do experts have to say?","The story so far: The Supreme Court is slated to hear on May 24 a petition filed by the NGO Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) seeking a direction to the Election Commission of India (ECI) to upload polling station-wise voter turnout data on its website within 48 hours of the conclusion of polling for each phase of the Lok Sabha elections. Additionally, the NGO has flagged a sizeable difference in the initial turnout figures released by the ECI soon after the conclusion of polling and the final voter percentages published subsequently . Such discrepancies have evoked sharp questions from the Opposition about the authenticity of the polling data available in the public domain, and the possibility of manipulation at the counting stage. On May 20, an intervention application was also moved in the case by advocate Mehmood Pracha who contested polls from the Rampur Lok Sabha constituency as an independent candidate. He alleged that the concerned returning officer (RO) had not furnished copies of the Form 17C record of votes polled in his constituency as mandated by the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961 (1961 Rules). Echoing similar concerns, a group of civil society members and former bureaucrats have also written to the apex poll body, urging it to “immediately disclose” the authenticated record of voter turnout of every polling station — as contained in Part I of Form 17C (Account of votes recorded)— via the ECI website. “The inordinate delay in the release of voter turnout, coupled with the unusually high revision of nearly 6% [in the first two phases] sans any explanation” has raised doubts over the voter turnout figures, the letter said. As per the 1961 Rules, the ECI has to maintain two forms that have data on the number of electors and the votes polled — Forms 17A and 17C. While the former is used to record the details of every voter who comes into a polling booth and casts his or her vote, the latter is an account of all the votes recorded. Under Rule 49S(2), a presiding officer is mandated to furnish a copy of the entries made in Form 17C to the polling agents of the candidates at the close of polling. Part I of Form 17C contains crucial information — the identification numbers of the EVMs used in the polling station, the total number of electors assigned to the polling station, the total number of voters as entered in the register for voters (Form 17A), the number of voters who decided not to record their votes after signing the register, the number of voters who were not allowed to vote, the total number of test votes and votes recorded per EVM. Part II of the same form contains the results of the counting carried out on the stipulated day. The data in Form 17C is used by candidates to verify the results on counting day by matching it with the EVM count. Subsequently, an election petition can also be moved in the concerned High Court in case of any discrepancies. The ECI has come under scrutiny for not releasing the absolute number of votes polled in any constituency in this general election, unlike in 2019. Only voting percentages have been published, that too after significant delay — after 11 days of the first phase of polling held on April 19 and four days after the second phase of polling held on April 26. On May 7, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge wrote to leaders of the INDIA bloc saying that the polling data released by the ECI “raises serious doubts.” He flagged that apart from the delay, the voter turnout data released by the ECI “does not mention crucial yet related figures, such as the votes polled in each Parliamentary Constituency and in the respective Assembly Constituencies.” He also alleged that the “credibility of the Election Commission” was at an all-time low. “...On earlier occasions, the Commission has published voter turnout data within 24 hours of polling. What has changed this time? Why has the Commission failed to issue any clarification to justify the delay, despite being repeatedly questioned by political parties as well as political activists?”, Mr. Kharge asked. He also expressed concern that in his 52 years of electoral life, he had never witnessed such a high increment of voting percentages in the final published data. The provisional polling percentages for the first phase released by the ECI at 7 pm on April 19 was about 60% and for the second phase on April 26 was 60.96%. However, the final figures released on April 30 for the first phase stood at 66.14% (an increase of more than 5.5%) and 66.71% for the second phase (an increase of more than 5.74%). The Congress chief further questioned what was precluding the poll body from publishing the exact voter turnout data of each polling station when such information was already available with the polling agents of the candidates through Form 17C. Since no data had been released about the number of eligible voters (electors) in each parliamentary constituency, it was impossible to calculate whether the absolute number of voters had increased or decreased, Mr. Kharge said. TMC leader Mahua Moitra, the Lok Sabha candidate for Bengal’s Krishnanagar constituency, also took to the social media platform X to highlight how she was able to compile the number of voters in her constituency within 24 hours of polling. She demanded to know why the ECI had failed to publish this exact information for the previous phases of polling. Attention @ECISVEEP - here is data for my constituency with number of voters compiled within 24 hrs of polling. Why are you not able to give this for 4 phases? @abhishekaitc@MamataOfficialpic.twitter.com/EsineMFOFn In a scathing letter to Mr. Kharge, the ECI maintained that it has no legal obligation to furnish information about the absolute number of votes polled in every polling station to the general public. “It may be noted that Commission is not legally bound to publish any voter turnout data at the aggregate level of a constituency, a State or in a phase of election because voter turnout is recorded at polling station level in statutory Form 17 C which is prepared by the presiding officer and signed by the polling agents of candidates present. Copies of Form 17 C are shared with polling agents present immediately, as the strongest measure of transparency. So, candidates are aware and in possession of exact voter turnout data in absolute numbers even before it is known to the ECI,” the letter stipulated. Calling the allegations by Mr. Kharge an attempt to “create confusion, misdirection and impediments in the conduct of free and fair polls”, the poll body pointed out how voters continue to vote even after 6:00 pm due to long queues at polling stations resulting in variations in the estimated data on poll day. Notably, in an affidavit filed before the apex court, the ECI underscored that disclosure of data on the “Voter Turnout App” is a “voluntary” and “non-statutory” initiative intended for transparency and public facilitation. While pointing out that ADR had ignored the disclaimer that figures in the app were secondary and provisional data, it stressed that “tentative figures from a secondary source can never be the final turnout figure”. The Court was also apprised that online disclosure of Form 17C data could cause “confusion in the minds of voters” since it would also include postal ballot counts. “Indiscriminate disclosure, public posting on the website increases the possibility of the images being morphed, including the counting results which then can create widespread public discomfort and mistrust in the entire electoral processes”, the Commission claimed. Casting aspersions on ADR’s motive, the poll body said the plea was part of a “consistent mala fide campaign to raise doubts against the EC in every possible way by voicing misleading allegations”. The objective of “certain elements” or “vested interests” was to revert to paper ballots by generating an unwarranted atmosphere of suspicion in close proximity to an election, it alleged further. It also referred to ADR’s unsuccessful challenge in the EVM-VVPAT cross-verification case and claimed that the top Court had already discussed the issue of Form 17C and its various aspects. ADR has sought the Supreme Court’s intervention to direct the ECI to upload online scanned copies of Part I of Form 17C for all polling stations within 48 hours of the close of polling. Saying that such information is “readily available” with the poll body, the NGO has also sought the publication of detailed constituency and polling station-wise turnout data in both absolute numbers and percentage form. “The inordinate delay in the release of final voter turnout data, coupled with the unusually high revision (of over 5%) in the EC press note of April 30 and the absence of disaggregated constituency and polling station figures in absolute numbers, has raised concerns and public suspicion regarding the correctness of the data… These apprehensions must be addressed and put to rest,” the petition said. While seeking ECI’s response to the plea on May 17, Chief Justice of India (CJI) D.Y. Chandrachud, heading a three-judge Bench, asked the poll body’s counsel, “Every Polling Officer submits [voting records] by the evening, after 6 or 7 p.m., by which time the polling is completed. The Returning Officer would then have the data of the entire constituency. Why don’t you upload it?” ADR has also pointed out that many times polling agents are not available at polling booths to obtain the Form 17C data which necessitates the publication of such crucial information online. “The ECI always discloses absolute numbers of voter turnouts. This time they are only disclosing percentages. Usually the turnouts are out within 24 hours of the end of polling unlike this time and the increase in voter turnout in the final figures is unusually high,” Anjali Bharadwaj, Director of Common Cause earlier told The Hindu. She added that the poll body should upload a scanned copy of Form 17C as soon as it is submitted by the Presiding Officer to abate transparency concerns. Addressing the ECI’s assertion that access to Form 17C data by polling agents negates the need for such information to be published online, Jagdeep S. Chokkar, the founder of ADR, pointed out that political parties do not contest elections in all constituencies. “Does this mean that a party which is not contesting the election in a particular constituency, is not expected to have or should not have any interest in what happens in that particular constituency? This does not stand to reason,” he wrote in The Wire. The renowned activist also highlighted how smaller political parties cannot afford to have polling agents in all booths or constituencies due to financial constraints. In fact, The Hindu found that since one constituency has roughly 2,000-2,200 booths, a candidate needs to have approximately 6,000 polling agents in each constituency to be able to obtain a copy of Form 17C. “This shows that it is impossible for smaller parties and many independents to have polling agents in all booths,” Congress Rajya Sabha MP Shakti Singh Gohil said.

Lok Sabha elections: Who are BJP’s allies and how many seats has it ceded to them?,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/lok-sabha/lok-sabha-elections-who-has-bjp-allied-with-how-many-seats-has-it-ceded/article68164185.ece,"The Opposition’s INDIA may be splintering in certain States, but the NDA seems to be firming up as the BJP aims to win a third consecutive term. Here’s a look at who BJP’s allies are and at the seats they have nabbed from the ruling party","‘Abki baar 400 paar’ (this time will cross 400), BJP declared – setting a 400 plus seat target for the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the ongoing Lok Sabha elections. In the Budget session of the Lok Sabha, Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared, “The nation will definitely give NDA more than 400 seats and the BJP at least 370 seats.” India is currently polling in a seven-phase general election on April 19, and 26, May 7, 13, 20, and 25, and June 1. Results will be announced on June 4. Aiming to re-elect Mr. Modi for a third term, the BJP has allied with several parties at the State-level to contest 540 seats. For the first time, neither BJP nor its allies are contesting any of the seats in Kashmir (Baramulla, Anantnag-Rajouri and Srinagar). In the sixteenth Lok Sabha, the BJP and its current allies hold 336 seats while the Opposition coalition - Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) has approximately 118 seats. Of the 28 States and eight union territories, BJP has allied with regional parties in twelve States and one union territory — Maharashtra, Bihar, Assam, Karnataka, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Lakshadweep. In territories where the BJP contesting solo, the Indian National Congress is its primary competitor: this includes States like Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Rajasthan, Mizoram, Sikkim, Tripura, and Uttarakhand and Union territories Andaman and Nicobar, Chandigarh, Ladakh, and Jammu. In Punjab, Telangana, West Bengal, Delhi and Puducherry, the BJP is in a three-way fight. In Punjab, it faces the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Congress, while in Telangana, BJP faces newly-elected Congress and Bharat Rashtriya Samithi (BRS). In West Bengal, the BJP faces Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the Congress-Left alliance; in Delhi, it faces Congress on three seats and AAP on four seats. For Puducherry’s lone Lok Sabha seat, BJP is fighting against Congress and ex-ally All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK). BJP is also contesting solo in Odisha, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh for their respective State assembly constituency polls, being held simultaneously. Apart from Congress, it is up against regional parties like Sikkim Kranti Morcha (SKM) and Sikkim Democratic Front (SDF) for Sikkim’s 32-seat Assembly; the National People’s Party (NPP) for Arunachal Pradesh’s 60-seat Assembly, and Biju Janata Dal (BJD) for Odisha’s 147-seat Assembly. In Andhra Pradesh, BJP has allied with Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and Jana Sena Party (JSP) to contest 175 Assembly seats. The State is witnessing a three-way fight for both its Lok Sabha and State Assembly between the NDA, the Congress led by Y.S. Sharmila, and her brother Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party (YSRCP). Maharashtra: 48 seats In June 2022, veteran Shiv Sena minister Eknath Shinde revolted against party chief Uddhav Thackeray, splitting Sena into two factions. Shinde’s faction, which is now recognised as the real Shiv Sena and is fighting polls withthe iconic bow-and-arrow symbol, has allied with BJP for the Lok Sabha polls. Similarly, in July 2023, Ajit Pawar revolted against his uncle and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, splitting the party into two. Ajit Pawar’s faction, which has retained the clock symbol and the party name, has allied with the BJP. Also Read: Crowded field: On Maharashtra politics After weeks of negotiation, the Mahayuti comprising of BJP, NCP and Shiv Sena finalised its seat-sharing deal for the State’s 48 seats as follows: BJP (28), Shiv Sena (15), NCP (4), and Rashtriya Samaj Paksha (1). Its opposing coalition — Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) — has finalised its poll-pact as follows: Shiv Sena UBT [Sena (UBT)] on 21 seats, Congress on 17 seats, and NCP Sharadchandra Pawar (NCP-SP) on 10 seats. Maharashtra is currently polling in five phases on April 19 and 26, and May 7, 13, and 20. Bihar: 40 seats On January 28, Janata Dal (United) [JD(U)] chief Nitish Kumar switched loyalties for the fifth time this decade, rejoining the NDA. Along with him, allies Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) headed by Jitan Ram Manjhi and Rashtriya Lok Morcha (RLM) headed by Upendra Kushwaha broke away from the Mahagathbandhan to join the NDA. After successfully facing a floor test in his ninth term as Chief Minister, Mr. Kumar vowed, “Now, there is no need to go here and there. Now, I will remain here.” Similarly, Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) led by Chirag Paswan, which had contested against the JD(U) in the 2020 State polls, has allied with BJP once again. Mr. Paswan’s estranged uncle Pasupati Paras had split the party into two in 2021, taking five LJP MPs with him and forming the Rashtriya Lok Janshakti Party. He is also now allied with the BJP. On March 18, the NDA finalised its seat-sharing deal for the State’s 40 Lok Sabha seats, announcing that the BJP was set to fight 17 seats, JD(U) 16 seats, and HAM and RLM one seat each. The younger Paswan trumped his uncle as LJP (Ram Vilas) got five seats including Hajipur, to which Mr. Pasupati Paras had staked claim. In protest, Mr. Paswan resigned from his cabinet position, but still remains in the NDA. The NDA faces the Mahagathbandhan which will contest the 40 seats as follows — Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) on 23 seats, Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) on five seats, Congress on nine seats and the Left parties on the remaining five seats. Bihar is currently polling in a seven phases on April 19, 26, May 7, 13, 20, 25 and June 1. Assam: 14 seats BJP stuck with its old allies, the United People’s Party Liberal (UPPL) and Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), for Assam’s 14 seat-battle. Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma announced that BJP will fight on 11 seats, leaving AGP with two (Barpeta and Dhubri), while UPPL will field its candidate in Kokrajhar. It faced the Congress-AIUDF combination apart from Independent candidates. Assam polled in three phases on April 19, 26 and May 7. Karnataka: 28 seats After falling out with the Congress prior to the State elections in Karnataka, Janata Dal (Secular) [JD(S)] joined the NDA in September 2023 after party chief H.D. Kumaraswamy met BJP president J.P. Nadda and Union Home Minister Amit Shah in Delhi. The JD(S), which was reduced to a mere 18 seats in the 2023 State assembly polls, was given three seats in the 28-seat Lok Sabha battle in Karnataka, while BJP contested 25 seats. The NDA faced a tough battle from a resurgent Congress which recently swept the State polls winning 135 of 224 seats — its biggest win in the State since 1989 when it won 178 seats. Karnataka polled on April 26 and May 7. Jharkhand: 14 seats BJP has allied with its old partner All Jharkhand Students Union (AJSU) which has been given the Giridih seat, while BJP is fighting on 13 seats. The party is currently facing internal feuds over ticket distribution and tribal opposition in pockets. The party faces an embattled INDIA coalition comprised of Congress, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), RJD and the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Lennin) Liberation [CPI(ML)L], which currently heads the State government and is smarting from the recent arrest of ex-CM Hemant Soren in a land scam case. Banking on tribal ire over Mr. Soren’s arrest, Congress is contesting on seven seats, JMM five seats, and [CPI(ML)L] and RJD on one seat each. Jharkhand will poll in three phases on May 13, 26 and June 1. Uttar Pradesh: 80 seats With the successful inaugural ceremony of the Ram Mandir in Lord Ram’s birthplace in Ayodhya, BJP has set a target of capturing all 80 seats in Uttar Pradesh. However, Jat farmer protests, unemployment resentment, and unpaid agricultural dues rankle among the locals, making the BJP’s target a tough one to meet. Roping in regional outfits like Apna Dal (Soneylal), Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP), Nirbal Indian Shoshit Hamara Aam Dal (NISHAD) and Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), BJP is contesting its lowest number of seats since 2014 — 74 seats. On February 9, Mr. Modi announced that the Bharat Ratna — India’s highest civilian award — was conferred on former PM Chaudhary Charan Singh. In response, his grandson and RLD chief Jayant Chaudhary wrote “Dil Jeet Liya” (You have won our hearts) on X, shifting alliance from INDIA to the NDA. Om Prakash Rajbhar, who heads SBSP, had allied with Samajwadi Party (SP) in the 2022 State polls, before switching back to the NDA in 2023. Mr. Rajbhar was inducted into the UP cabinet in March this year. As per the final seat-sharing tally, BJP’s allyApna Dal (S) is contesting two seats, SBSP one seat, NISHAD on one seat and RLD on two seats. NDA faces the INDIA coalition, in which Congress is contesting on 17 seats and SP on 63 seats. Mr. Modi is seeking a third-term from Varanasi, while his top rival Mr. Rahul Gandhi is contesting from Rae Bareli — a Gandhi bastion since 1952. North East (Manipur, Meghalaya, Nagaland): 4 seats Backing its North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA) allies, BJP decided to support candidates of the Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP) for Nagaland’s lone seat and National People’s Party (NPP) for Meghalaya’s two seats. For one of Manipur’s seats — Outer Manipur, BJP backed its ally Naga People’s Front (NPF). With BJP falling out with its NEDA allies, the Mizo National Front (MNF) in Mizoram and Sikkim Kranti Morcha (SKM) in Sikkim, each State’s lone Lok Sabha seat witnessed a four-way fight between Congress, BJP and the local parties. While Meghalaya, Nagaland, Mizoram and Sikkim went to the polls on April 19, owing the current ethnic tensions, Manipur’s two seats went to the polls on April 19 and 26. Tamil Nadu: 39 seats In September 2023, the AIADMK snapped ties with the BJP amid strained relations with its State head K. Annamalai. For almost a year prior, Mr. Annamalai had repeatedly targeted AIADMK, its policies and its leader E. Palaniswami (EPS), who took over the party in 2022. EPS’ prime rival O. Paneerselvam (OPS) who was ousted from AIADMK in 2022, has reiterated his support to the BJP. His support went in vain as the BJP announced it would contest 20 seats, Tamil Maanila Congress (Moopanar) [TMC (M)] on three seats, Pakkali Makkal Katchi (PMK) on 10 seats, and TTV Dinakaran’s Amma Makkal Munnettra Kazagam (AMMK) on two seats. Four other regional parties — Indhiya Jananayaga Katchi, Inthiya Makkal Kalvi Munnetra Kazhagam, Puthiya Needhi Katchi and Tamizhaga Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam— fought under the BJP’s ‘Lotus’ symbol. Tamil Nadu’s electoral battle was a three-way fight as the NDA faced two coalitions — INDIA and the AIADMK-led coalition. INDIA’s seat-sharing tally was as follows — Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) on 21 seats, Congress on nine seats, CPI, CPI(M), and Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) on two seats each, Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK) on one seat each. Kongunadu Makkal Desia Katchi fought on one seat under DMK’s ‘rising sun’ symbol. In the other coalition, AIADMK allied with another ex-NDA ally Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK), with them respectively contesting 32 seats and five seats. Two other parties — Puthiya Tamilagam and Social Democratic Party of India— fought on one seat each, under AIADMK’s ‘two leaves’ symbol. The southern State went to polls in a single phase on April 19. Andhra Pradesh: 25 Lok Sabha seats, 175 Assembly constituencies Welcoming ex-ally TDP back into the NDA, BJP and actor-turned-politician Pawan Kalyan’s JSP formed an alliance. As both Lok Sabha and State Assembly seats went to the polls simultaneously, the three parties agreed on two seat-sharing formulae — BJP contested six Lok Sabha seats and 10 Assembly constituencies while JSP contested on two Lok Sabha seats and 21 Assembly seats. The bulk of seats was retained by TDP, which contested in 17 Lok Sabha seats and 144 Assembly constituencies. TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu had previously allied with the BJP in 1999 and 2014, before pulling out of the NDA in 2018 due to differences over the granting of ‘special status’ to Andhra Pradesh. In 2019, he joined the ‘Mahagathbandhan’ led by Congress and 17 other parties, which failed to stop the BJP. Currently, the BJP-JSP-TDP combination faces the YSRCP and the Congress, which is now headed by Y.S Sharmila in the State. Ms. Sharmila, the newly- appointed Andhra Congress chief and YSRCP chief Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s younger sister, , recently merged her party YSR Telangana Party with Congress after it came to power in Telangana in 2023. Incidentally, Y.S. Sharmila was instrumental in running YSRCP’s successful padayatras in 2012-13 when Mr. Reddy was in jail. She also campaigned for him in 2019. The siblings have now fallen out and have been attacking each other in political rallies, besides directing vitriol at their prime target — Mr. Naidu. Andhra Pradesh went to the polls in a single phase for both Lok Sabha and Assembly elections on May 13. Kerala: 20 seats One of the few remaining States where BJP has minimal to no presence, Kerala saw the BJP contest 16 seats, along with its traditional ally Bharath Dharma Jana Sena (BDJS) on four seats. While the main fight is between the two coalitions — United Democratic Front (UDF) led by Congress and the Left Democratic Front (LDF) led by CPI (M)— NDA is seeking to make inroads, with Mr. Modi holding multiple rallies in the State. BJP is yet to win a Lok Sabha seat in Kerala. Kerala went to polls on April 26. Lakshadweep Backing its Maharashtra ally NCP, BJP extended support to NCP candidate T.P. Yousuf. With the split in NCP, incumbent MP Mohammed Faizal P.P. was fielded by NCP-SP to face Congress’ Muhammed Hamdullah Sayeed. Both NCP-SP and Congress are members of INDIA. Lakshadweep went to the polls on April 19. General Elections 2024

"Lok Sabha elections 2024: Examining Modi, Kejriwal and Congress’ guarantees",https://www.thehindu.com/elections/lok-sabha/modi-kejriwal-and-congress-guarantees-for-lok-sabha-polls-do-they-address-voter-issues/article68178960.ece,"Its raining ‘guarantees’ during this Lok Sabha season, with ‘Modi ki Guarantee’ clashing with ‘Paanch Nyay’ and ‘Kejriwal ki 10 guarantee.’ Here’s a look at what they are and how they address voters’ concerns.","The story so far: With the polling for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections halfway complete, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is the latest to unroll its ‘guarantees’ to voters if elected to power. A day after AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal was released on interim bail from Tihar Jail, he swung into campaign mode, attacking his chief contender — Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging people to vote against ‘dictatorship.’ As of date, three national parties — the BJP, Congress and AAP — have issued a list of ‘guarantees’ targetting different strata of society, detailing schemes and freebies it would dole out if elected to power. The concept of listing ‘guarantees’ most recently proved successful during the Congress campaigns in Telangana and Karnataka in 2023. Prior to this, AAP had also rolled a slew of ‘promises’ targeting different occupational communities during the 2021 State elections in Goa, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, and Punjab. Here’s a look at the three lists of “guarantees” and what electoral issues they seek to address. Making an early headstart, the ruling party was the first to unveil its set of ‘guarantees’ in February, titled ‘Modi ki guarantee’ for a ‘Viksit Bharat’ (developed India) by 2047. Unlike the Opposition parties, BJP’s ‘guarantees’ are a promise to take ahead existing schemes of the Modi government. No major new policies or announcements have been made as an aim for the next term.

PTI Listing its achievements over the two Modi terms in welfare, development, restoring the glory of cultural heritage, youth, farmer and women empowerment, middle class gain, economic growth, digital infrastructure, J&K integration and foreign policy, BJP claims that a ‘Modi guarantee’ means a ‘guarantee which will be fulfilled.’ It asserts that by following this holistic approach, India will be on track to achieve developed status by 2047. Here is an overview of Modi ki guarantees: Welfare guaranteed: Ensuring saturation of government schemes to provide housing, health insurance, electricity, food grains and drinking water to all Empowering Annadatas: Continuation of uninterrupted credit access, focus on ethanol blending, farm-assistance via crop insurance and minimum income support Nari Shakti: Access to bank accounts for women, loans to women-led businesses, creating women millionaires, free cooking gas connection, and an emphasis on women education Vikas bhi Virasat bhi: Developing cultural sites like Varanasi and Ujjain, and making Ayodhya the ‘spiritual capital of the world’ with the Ram Mandir at its centre. Reclaiming Indian antiquities from across the world and addition of Indian sites to UNSECO’s World Heritage List to celebrate India’s cultural traditions as well as contemporary aspirations. Promising ecosystem for Amrit Peedhi: Creating jobs via credit access to young entrepreneurs, establishing labs for projects aimed at solving society’s issues, emphasis on digital literacy, higher education enrollment and implementation of the National Education Policy 2020. Middle class emerges winner: Developing India’s metro network and Vande Bharat trains, continuing tax cuts and affordable housing, and basic infrastructure projects in urban areas to aid middle class citizens. Indian economy: Increase in Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue, export goods, and growth of Medium, Small and Micro enterprise (MSME) sector to make India the world’s third largest economy. Digital India: Global deployment of India’s digital payments platform – Unified Payments Interface (UPI), nationwide 5G deployment, and focus on supercomputing and digital health Abrogation of Article 370: Reducing terror incidents and civilian deaths in Jammu-Kashmir, increased industrial growth, investments, innovation and tourism in the Valley post abrogation of Article 370 and revoking J&K’s special status. Bharat A Vishwamitra in Making: Elevating India’s stature to new heights via foreign policy agreements like the New Delhi G20 Declaration, Vaccine Maitri and seeking permanent membership in the UN Security Council. As the BJP’s poll campaign gets sharper, Mr. Modi has announced five new guarantees in a West Bengal rally— no religion-based reservations, no alteration to SC/ST/OBC reservation, no ban on Ram Navami celebrations, no quashing of the Ram Janmabhoomi Supreme Court verdict, and no stay on the implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). Building on the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra led by Rahul Gandhi, Congress rolled out its manifesto titled ‘Nyay Patra’ along with a ‘Paanch Nyay’ list detailing twenty-five guarantees it will fulfill if voted to power. Focusing on youth, women, farmers, labourers and marginalised communities, Congress’ guarantees offer many new policy changes, meet popular demands like a legal guarantee for MSP, removal of the cap on reservation, farm loan waiver and a nationwide caste census. Congress’ 5 sets of ‘guarantees’ Notably, it has not expressly promised to repeal any of the laws passed by the Modi government, including abrogation of Article 370, the GST Bill, and the amendments to the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD) law — all of which the party opposed in Parliament. Curiously, reverting to the old pension scheme — an issue which the party raised vociferously during the Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh State polls, has also not featured in the ‘guarantees.’ Following are the five sets of ‘Nyay’ promised by Congress: Yuva Nyay (Justice for youth): Assurance of 30 lakh new central government jobs, a scheme offering a one-year internship to all educated youth, stringent laws to eliminate exam paper leaks, social security for gig workers and allocating Rs. 5000 crores for start-ups Nari Nyay (Justice for women): Mahalakshmi scheme offering Rs 1 lakh per year to poor women, 50% reservation for women in central government jobs, double central contribution to ASHA, Anganwadi, and Mid-Day Meal workers’ salaries, establishing legal advisors for women in every village, and doubling of existing women’s hostels (Savitribai Phule Hostels). Kisaan Nyay (Justice for farmers): Legal guarantee of Minimum Support Price (MSP) for crops, establish a Standing Loan Waiver Commission to systematically evaluate and recommend debt waivers, guaranteed insurance payment within 30 days of crop loss, import-export policy favouring farmers, and no GST on farming essentials Shramik Nyay (Justice to labourers): Universal healthcare coverage for all, national minimum wage of Rs. 400, Employment Guarantee Act for urban regions, life and accident insurance schemes for unorganised workers, and halting contractualisation in core government functions Hissedari Nyay (Justice to marginalised communities): Comprehensive social, economic and caste census, removing 50% cap on reservations, special budget for SC/ST communities, settlement of claims under the Forest Rights Act within one year, and notifying populous Scheduled Tribal areas as Scheduled Areas. Apart from these guarantees, Rahul Gandhi has promised to waive off educational loans including unpaid interest until March 15 this year and waive off exam fees for government exams. In rallies, Mr. Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra have also promised to provide ten kilos of food grains every month to BPL (below poverty line) families and cashless medical treatment insured up to Rs 25 lakhs. Following the Delhi model of governance, AAP has released its list of ten guarantees it will fulfill if voted to power in the Centre. Similar to his pre-poll campaign in Delhi and Punjab, Mr. Kejriwal has promised free power, education, healthcare and two crore jobs. On a macro-policy level, he has promised full statehood to Delhi, the retrieval of Indian lands ‘annexed’ by China, offered MSP for crops as recommended by the Swaminathan Commission, promised removal of corruption from the roots and said he will scrap the Agniveer scheme. The ‘guarantees’ do not mention any dole-outs to women as promised by the party in most State election campaigns. They also do not mention a pan-India caste census, an anti-paper leak law or even the repeal of the amended GNCTD law – a Bill the party opposed vehemently in the Parliament. INDIA की सरकार पूरी करेगी, केजरीवाल की 10 गारंटी 🇮🇳💯#KejriwalKi10Guaranteepic.twitter.com/RhOoirPfeE Moreover, Mr. Kejriwal said that he had not discussed the guarantees with his allies but assured the public that they would have no objections to it, as it would lay the foundation for a “new India.” Affirming that he did not wish to be India’s Prime Minister, he said, “If the INDIA bloc comes to power, I will ensure that these (guarantees) will be implemented on a war footing”. List of Kejriwal’s guarantees: The above ‘guarantees’ are in addition to a detailed manifesto which both Congress and BJP have released. AAP, which is fighting on only 22 seats, has not issued any such manifesto. As per a pre-poll survey by Lokniti-CSDS, unemployment and price rise were the key concerns of nearly half the citizens. 62% of those surveyed mentioned that getting jobs has become more difficult in the past five years, while 72% fell that prices have risen in the same time period. Both State and central governments have been held responsible by 57% for the dearth of jobs. Another issue plaguing the electorate is rising corruption. 55% of people surveyed felt it had increased since 2019 while 19% said it had decreased. The Centre was blamed by 25% as compared to the states (19%) while 56% blamed both for the rise in corruption. Class divide has also increased starkly in India, Lokniti found. Unemployment and inflation rank highest among concerns for voters Poorer respondents felt that it more difficult to have their needs met and save money now than five years ago. The percentage of those who felt this way was lower among respondents with higher financial income. A greater number of rich respondents felt that their standard of living was better now than in 2019, while half of the poor people surveyed felt they were worse off now. Other findings of the survey were that more people feel that the development activities of the government favour only the rich, and that rural distress and farmers woes are real. Both Congress and AAP’s guarantees tackle the issue of unemployment head on by promising immediate recruitment of youth in central jobs. BJP’s guarantees make an indirect pitch, assuring increased funding to start-ups, funding for setting up innovation labs, and more domestic and foreign investment in manufacturing, claiming this will provide for more job opportunities. Inflation is not really addressed by any of these guarantees in terms of lowering the price of commodities or boosting consumer demand. Recognising some basic needs of citizens, all three guarantees promise free healthcare. While the BJP promises free rations, gas connections, tapped water, affordable housing and subsidised electricity via solar panels, AAP assures free power to the poor and free education. Tackling corruption, AAP has vowed to “eradicate it from the root,” while BJP has re-iterated its zero-tolerance policy. Congress’ guarantees address another voter concern — the class divide. Apart from a caste census, Congress has promised a comprehensive social and economic census to address the needs of marginalized communities. Farmer distress is addressed by the three parties in varied manners. BJP has promised to continue and expand its farm-related schemes on credit access, loans, millets, income support, incentive-linked farming, and MSP for crops, while AAP has promised to pay MSP for crops as per the Swaminathan Commission. Going a step further, Congress has promised a farm loan waiver, guaranteed crop insurance payment within 30 days and exempting essential farming goods from GST. Voters reportedly believe in Modi’s guarantees (23%) more than Rahul Gandhi’s (17%), giving the BJP a slight edge in the elections, reveals Lokniti. Further analysis shows that trust in Modi’s guarantees was higher among the middle-aged and older citizens as compared to young and working voters. Among rural voters, Modi’s guarantees enjoyed higher trust in villages as compared to cities. Among the upper middle-class, Modi’s guarantees enjoy an 18% trust gain compared to Rahul Gandhi’s list. It is among middle-class voters, town-dwellers and college-educated voters where the trust gap between the two guarantees is the least. Lok Sabha

Taking examples from cities across the world, is there any truth to Mr Modi’s comments that free bus travel adds to traffic woes?","Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a recent television interview, said that some political parties were offering free bus travel for women in order to win elections. He argued that this took away 50% of the patronage of the metro rail system where it existed. He said this made the metro rail unviable and would also add to the traffic woes and impact the environment. Women are offered free bus travel in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Delhi, Punjab and Telangana. In Tamil Nadu, it is called the Vidiyal Payanam Thittam (scheme). This was one of the earliest welfare schemes of the DMK government under CM MK Stalin when they came to power in 2021, at the height of the second wave of the Covid pandemic. Given that it was one of the flagship schemes, it was only natural that Stalin reacted sharply to Modi’s comments. Citing statistics, he said the patronage for the Chennai Metro rail since 2019, had only increased. He added that since Modi subscribed to the “retrograde ideologies of the RSS”, he feared anything that would lead to the empowerment of women. He also criticised the Modi government for not releasing funds for phase 2 of Chennai metro rail. What do the hard numbers say about the bus travel scheme in Tamil Nadu?

BJP’s victory march has begun from Land of Rising Sun: Pema Khandu,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/arunachal-pradesh-assembly/bjps-victory-march-has-begun-from-land-of-rising-sun-pema-khandu/article68243313.ece,"The BJP won 46 of the 60 seats in Arunachal Pradesh Assembly election, five more than in 2019","GUWAHATI A tragedy – the death of his father and former Chief Minister Dorjee Khandu in a helicopter crash – saw him winning his first Assembly election uncontested from the Mukto seat in 2011. Barring the 2019 elections, Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Pema Khandu has won the “family constituency” uncontested thrice, the first time for the BJP ahead of the State’s Mandate 2024. In doing so, the 44-year-old established himself as the power centre in India’s easternmost State. “The BJP’s victory march in the country has begun from India’s Land of the Rising Sun,” he said after the BJP won 46 of the 60 seats, five more than in 2019. He credited the victory to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership and the pro-development pitch of his party. Mr. Khandu held various positions in Congress after joining it in 2000 but his political graph kept rising after he filled the void left behind by his father in Mukto. He became a Minister in Nabam Tuki’s Congress government and the BJP-supported government of Kalikho Pul after a constitutional crisis led to the imposition of President’s Rule in January 2016. The late Pul’s government was short-lived after the Supreme Court restored Mr. Tuki’s status as the Chief Minister. But the latter resigned and Mr. Khandu, then 37, succeeded him. Mr. Khandu’s political acumen became apparent three months into his term when he masterminded the defection of 43 Congress MLAs to the People’s Party of Arunachal (PPA), then an ally of the BJP. In December 2016, he joined the BJP along with most of the PPA legislators to hand the saffron party its second government in the State. He led the BJP to a big win in 2019 to continue in power, allegedly clipping the wings of many who tried to form coteries within the party. A history graduate from Delhi’s Hindu College, Mr. Khandu is a member of the Buddhist Monpa community that dominates Tawang and parts of West Kameng districts. He is credited with making Arunachal Pradesh a sports powerhouse in the northeast and is known to sing Kishore Kumar and Mohammad Rafi classics at official and cultural gatherings. In the run-up to the simultaneous Assembly and Lok Sabha polls on April 19, he promised a government that would be corruption-free, transparent, and people-centric. “As a disciplined party, the BJP can provide good governance,” he said, adding that the party leadership will decide who will head the government in Arunachal Pradesh after the Lok Sabha results are declared on June 4. Mr. Khandu later met Governor K.T. Parnaik and tendered his resignation along with his Council of Ministers. The Governor subsequently ordered the dissolution of the Assembly.

BJP poised to get third term; both BJP and Congress may register small gains in vote share,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/lok-sabha/bjp-poised-to-get-third-term-both-bjp-and-congress-may-register-small-gains-in-vote-share/article68243852.ece,"For the Congress, its gains are likely to be rather chaotically spread across a few States, perhaps not enough for the party to make an impressive gain in terms of seats","In continuation of the reports by Lokniti-CSDS in this paper (The Hindu, April 11-13) the BJP seems to have held on its core bastions and warded off the challenge elsewhere. This is the most dominant trend picked up by Lokniti’s post-election survey conducted by visiting the homes of nearly 20,000 respondents selected through systematic random sampling. As we await the actual counting of votes on Tuesday, Lokniti’s post-election survey (see box for details) confirms the comfortable edge that the BJP enjoys in the 18th parliamentary election, and is set to form the government for a third term in a row. The Lokniti Team will bring out systematic analyses of various factors that may have contributed to this trend. Our survey suggests that both BJP and Congress will add a little bit to their respective vote shares from the previous election (37.4% and 19.5%, respectively) to poll 40% and 23%, respectively. A note of caution is in order here. While the gains for both Congress and BJP are in the range of 3% to 4%, the margin of error for this calculation of vote shares is ±3.08. Even as the BJP holds an edge in terms of vote share and is likely to add to its vote share by around three percentage points over the last election, the Congress too, will refuse to recede. An equal increase of about three per cent votes will ensure that the Congress as a party will remain in the reckoning, although as a distant second. Thus, though the Congress may gain votes compared to its debacle in 2014, that gain might not be sufficient to shake the BJP. This fact, and the spatial spread of votes, will determine the seat shares of these parties. A limited but significant accretion to the vote shares of both parties hints at the attrition of some of the smaller parties. Also read: Lokniti CSDS pre-poll survey for 2024 Lok Sabha elections: a package The BJP made every effort this time to make an impact in both States of the east, and of the south. These efforts are likely to pay off with BJP’s vote in these regions increasing compared with last time. On the other hand, for the Congress, its gains are likely to be rather chaotically spread across a few States, perhaps not enough for the party to make an impressive gain in terms of seats. This asymmetry of performance is likely to help the BJP and disappoint the Congress. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is Congress’ ally only in Gujarat, Haryana and Delhi; and the Trinamool Congress (TMC) only in Uttar Pradesh. Also Read : CSDS-Lokniti 2024 pre-poll survey | Key decisions and political implication for BJP Ever since the BJP re-emerged as a dominant player, the fate of State parties has been hanging in balance. But the compulsions of the Congress to enter into alliances in most States, and the corresponding caution taken by the BJP to fortify the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), has ensured that for the State parties, the outcome tomorrow will be a temporary breather. Many State parties will be poised to play an important part, either in the ruling coalition or in the Opposition coalition. These, of course, are the trends from the survey. On Tuesday, we shall get to know the picture emerging from actual count of millions of votes cast over the past seven weeks. That will be followed by Lokniti’s analysis of how that outcome was shaped. Also read: Exit poll 2024 highlights The Lokniti programme of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), Delhi conducted a nationwide post-poll survey. The fieldwork for the post-poll survey was conducted in 23 States after each phase of voting. The fieldwork began from April 20, 2024 and will go on till June 3, 2024. So far, 18,014 voters have been interviewed (the data for the last phase will be added after the completion of the fieldwork on June 3) in 191 parliamentary constituencies spread across 772 polling stations in 23 States. The respondents randomly selected from the electoral rolls were approached by trained field investigators for an interview at their place of residence after votes had been cast in their respective constituencies.

"Counting of votes: BJP, INDIA ask poll panel to stick to prescribed process",https://www.thehindu.com/elections/lok-sabha/counting-of-votes-bjp-india-ask-poll-panel-to-stick-to-prescribed-process/article68243809.ece,Both BJP and INDIA submit separate memorandums to the EC; BJP fears attempts to undermine electoral process; INDIA wants strict monitoring of EVM control units,"Leaders of both the ruling BJP and Opposition INDIA bloc met with members of the Election Commission (EC) on June 2 and demanded strict adherence to the established processes of counting of votes of the Lok Sabha elections, scheduled for June 4. While the BJP warned the EC against “attempts to undermine the integrity of the electoral process” by the INDIA bloc and “certain organisations, in the guise of civil society,” the INDIA bloc urged the EC to ensure that the control units of the electronic voting machines (EVMs) are moved through CCTV-monitored corridors and the current date-and-time display of each be verified. Ministers in the Union government, Nirmala Sitharaman and Piyush Goyal, representing the BJP, submitted a petition and asked the EC to ensure the safety of the counting process and that every official engaged in the counting process was fully conversant with the details of the prescribed process. “We also ask the ECI to take cognisance of the systematic attempts to undermine the electoral process and take stringent action against those responsible, as well as issue a public statement affirming the integrity of the electoral process and warning against any attempts to disrupt the democratic process,” said Mr. Goyal after the meeting. In the letter handed over to the EC, the BJP noted the verdict of the Supreme Court of India in April this year on challenges by civil society organisations on the use of EVMs, where the apex court dismissed any apprehensions about their misuse. “Now that they (civil society bodies) have failed in the law courts and also have serious apprehension that they failed in the court of public opinion, these bodies now want to resort to anarchy,” the letter said. “These manufactured controversies are intended to create mistrust in the electoral process and instigate unrest among citizens,” the letter further stated. The BJP also alleged that the Opposition, with civil society organisations fronting them, had a “toolkit” aimed at discrediting the electoral process, including a “Delhi Resolution” adopted on May 28 by “unknown, unverified persons” which outlines a series of actions, including protests and writing to the President of India and other high constitutional officials to undermine the results. The BJP’s delegation met with EC officials barely minutes after the INDIA bloc’s delegation met the officials to share their apprehensions over the counting of votes. Senior leaders Sitaram Yechury, D. Raja, Salman Khurshid, T.R. Baalu and Abhishek Singhvi, among others, were part of the delegation. In a memorandum to the EC, they said that it was essential to acknowledge that counting officials requisitioned from local authorities, schools, universities, banks etc., often failed to fully understand all the aspects of the counting process, despite training by the EC. “This mismatch can be challenging for the counting agents, particularly when counting officials ask for written ECI orders/guidelines for every request being made,” the representation said, adding that there was a lack of clarity on the precise details involved in the counting process. They demanded safe movement of the control units through a CCTV-monitored corridor, verification of the current date and time displayed on the control units, confirmation of the start and end time and date of the voting process to the counting agents. “This verification is important because unless it is done, there is no authenticity that it is the same control unit that came from the polling booth, that it has not been changed,” Mr. Yechury said. “The previous experience of counting process also reveals that in many cases the counting officials rush into declaring the results of one machine to the other, leaving scope for manipulation. The ECI must issue necessary instructions that the counting officials must wait and allow all counting agents to record the results before moving from one machine to another and from one round to the next,” the memorandum said. It also sought strict adherence to the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961. Citing reports that postal ballots would be counted towards to the end in some districts, the memorandum asked for this process to be completed in the beginning, as per the rules. “Clear instructions from the ECI are expected,” Mr. Raja added.

"UDF, LDF rubbish exit poll results, BJP sees a political change in Kerala",https://www.thehindu.com/elections/lok-sabha/udf-and-ldf-rubbish-exit-poll-projections/article68243318.ece,LDF brands exit polls as a politically motivated exercise done without the aid of any scientific findings; UDF’s K. Muraleedharan especially refutes projections in Attingal and Thrissur; BJP leader V. Muraleedharan says the party is poised to open its account in Kerala,"The United Democratic Front (UDF) and the Left Democratic Front (LDF) have rubbished exit poll reports, which projected significant gains for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the Lok Sabha elections in Kerala. Meanwhile, the BJP leaders said that the poll results would usher in a new era of political re-alignment in the State, sounding the death knell of LDF-UDF revolving door politics. LDF convener E.P. Jayarajan branded the exit polls as a politically motivated exercise which was carried out without the aid of any scientific findings or ground-level analysis. “All the exit polls have taken a stand that parrots what the BJP has been claiming about the poll results. That makes it even more suspicious. The BJP has hardly any chance of opening its account in Kerala. The Kerala society, with a highly educated and secular population, does not wish for a communal party to win from here. Considering how the exit polls have been projected, extreme vigil should be maintained during the counting process,” said Mr. Jayarajan. Despite the largely favourable projections for the UDF, Congress leader K. Muraleedharan, who contested from Thrissur, said that the exit polls have got it wrong regarding BJP, which will yet again get zero Lok Sabha seats from the State. He especially refuted the projections for the Thrissur and Attingal, which some pollsters expected the BJP to win. “The UDF is sure of winning in Thrissur. Suresh Gopi, the BJP candidate, will end up third. In case he ends up in second place, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan would be responsible for it. The BJP can secure second place only with cross voting from the LDF. In all the seven Assembly constituencies in Thrissur, the fight was between the UDF and the LDF,” he said. Regarding the projections for the Attingal constituency, he said that even Union Minister V. Muraleedharan, the BJP candidate from the constituency, would be surprised by the projection that the BJP would win the seat. CPI(M) Central committee member A.K. Balan expressed confidence that the INDIA bloc would win all the seats in Kerala. However, if the BJP manages to win a seat, the UDF would be responsible for it. “Exit polls are untrustworthy. In 2004, most polls projected the NDA to come to power. However, it was the UPA which came to power. The pro-Modi wave of 2019 does not exist now. An anti-Modi verdict will be reflected in the elections. In Kerala, the LDF will have a major win,” he said. BJP leader V.Muraleedharan said that the BJP is poised to open its account in Kerala. Votes will flow to the BJP both from the LDF and the UDF. BJP State president K.Surendran went a step further and said that the party would better even the exit poll projections, winning 5 to 6 seats. The BJP stands to gain from the anti-incumbency against the LDF government in the State. The people of Kerala have begun to see BJP as an alternative to the LDF and the UDF, said Mr. Surendran.

pitched polls as a vote on democracy",https://www.thehindu.com/elections/lok-sabha/in-uttar-pradesh-bjp-focused-on-temple-opposition-pitched-polls-as-a-vote-on-democracy/article68244142.ece,"Akhilesh Yadav said the elections were a vote on India’s democracy and cautioned voters that if the BJP returned to power, they may introduce a law which will take rights from farmers and marginalised communities","The campaign for Uttar Pradesh, politically the most critical state, which elects 80 MPs to the lower house of parliament, saw the major political parties pitching their campaign agendas across the State in intense campaigning. The Bharatiya Janata Party concentrated on religious issues like the Ram Temple, and its nationalism pitch with the party’s well-oiled organisational machinery taking the narrative deep into the hinterland. The BJP also engineered robust social coalitions with Other Backward Classes (OBCs) caste centric sub-regional parties like the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) of Om Prakash Rajbhar, the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) of Jayant Chaudhary, Annupriya Patel’s Apna Dal (Sonelal), and NISHAD party of Sanjay Nishad in a bid to make sure nothing was left to chance. The Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Congress led a spirited campaign for the opposition INDIA bloc. It focused on issues such as economic anxiety, farmers distress, and alleged erosion of Constitutional and democratic institutions during BJP rule with leaders claiming that the 2024 polls were a vote to save Indian democracy which is under grave threat under the BJP dispensation. The Caste Census pitch also dominated the campaign vocabulary of the INDIA alliance. The broader rainbow alliance that the SP formed for the 2022 assembly polls with multiple sub-regional parties was missing in the Lok Sabha elections with two of its former allies, the RLD and the SBSP crossing over to the NDA. The BJP’s campaign pitch in U.P. had Ram Temple at the core with the Prime Minister Narendra Modi even claiming that the Congress and SP would bulldoze the temple if elected, adding that the opposition should learn from Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath where to use bulldozers.
“These parties (Congress and SP) disrespected Ram Lalla for decades and when after 500 years, the dream of a grand Ram Temple was fulfilled in Ayodhya, they rejected the invitation to the consecration ceremony. If the SP-Congress come to power, they will send Ram Lalla back to the tent and bulldoze the temple,” said the PM in a Barabanki rally. Mr. Modi even accused the two INDIA alliance parties of allying with forces who insult the people of U.P. The playbook of the SP and the Congress is dangerous. They seek votes here, but in south India, when their partners use abusive language to describe the people of U.P. and Sanatana Dharma, they remain silent,” the Prime Minister alleged, speaking in Janupur. Other top BJP leaders aggressively pitched the revocation of Article 370 in Kashmir, and India’s tough stand on terror. SP president Akhilesh Yadav said the elections were a vote on India’s democracy and cautioned voters that if the BJP returned to power, they may introduce a law which will take rights from farmers and marginalised communities like the Scheduled Caste (SC) and backwards.
“This 2024 Lok Sabha election is not only our election but also the election of the coming generations. Just like the Samudra manthan (churning of the ocean), this is an election to save the Constitution and democracy,” he said in many of his rallies. Mr. Yadav and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi pushed for a caste-based-census alleging that the BJP has deliberately avoided the caste census exercise as it is afraid of giving legitimate rights to backwards and marginalised sections. In Eastern and central U.P. which have sizeable OBC populations the issue was at the forefront of the INDIA alliance parties campaign pitch. The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) led by four-time U.P. CM Mayawati, once a formidable player in the electoral calculus of U.P. went solo. The party president was missing from campaigning for most of the election. She removed her heir apparent and nephew Akash Anand from key organisational posts in the middle of the elections. General Elections 2024

New Sankalps from the Sadhana in Kanniyakumari,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/lok-sabha/new-sankalps-from-the-sadhana-in-kanniyakumari/article68244146.ece,None,"My fellow Indians, The biggest festival of democracy, the 2024 Lok Sabha Elections, are concluding today in our nation, the Mother of Democracy. After a three-day spiritual journey in Kanniyakumari, I have just boarded the plane for Delhi. Through the day, Kashi and numerous other seats have been in the midst of voting. My mind is filled with so many experiences and emotions... I feel a boundless flow of energy within myself. The 2024 Lok Sabha elections are the first in the Amrit Kaal. I began my campaign a few months ago from Meerut, the land of the First War of Independence of 1857. Since then, I have traversed across the length and breadth of our great nation. The final rally of these elections took me to Hoshiarpur in Punjab, the land of the great Gurus and a land associated with Sant Ravidas Ji. After that, I came to Kanniyakumari, at the feet of Maa Bharti. It is natural that the fervour of the elections was echoing in my heart and mind. The multitude of faces seen in rallies and road shows came in front of my eyes. The blessings from our Nari Shakti…the trust, the affection, all of this was a very humbling experience. My eyes were getting moist... I entered into a ‘sadhana’ (meditative state). And then, the heated political debates, the attacks and counter-attacks, the voices and words of accusations which are so characteristic of an election…they all vanished into a void. A sense of detachment came to grow within me...my mind became completely detached from the external world. Meditation becomes challenging amidst such huge responsibilities, but the land of Kanniyakumari and the inspiration of Swami Vivekananda made it effortless. As a candidate myself, I left my campaign in the hands of my beloved people of Kashi and came here. I am also grateful God for instilling me with these values from birth which I have cherished and tried to live up to. I was also thinking about what Swami Vivekananda must have experienced during his meditation at this very place in Kanniyakumari! A part of my meditation was spent in a similar stream of thoughts. Amidst this detachment, amidst the peace and silence, my mind was constantly thinking about the bright future of Bharat, the goals of Bharat. The rising sun at Kanniyakumari gave new heights to my thoughts, the vastness of the ocean expanded my ideas, and the expanse of the horizon continuously made me realize the unity, the Oneness, embedded in the depths of the universe. It seemed as if the observations and experiences undertaken in the lap of the Himalayas decades ago were being revived. Friends, Kanniyakumari has always been very close to my heart. The Vivekananda Rock Memorial in Kanniyakumari was built under the leadership of Shri Eknath Ranade ji. I had the opportunity to travel extensively with Eknath ji. During the construction of this Memorial, I had the opportunity to spend some time in Kanniyakumari as well. From Kashmir to Kanniyakumari... this is a common identity that is deeply ingrained in the heart of every citizen of the country. This is the ‘Shakti Peeth’ (seat of Shakti) where Maa Shakti incarnated as Kanya Kumari. At this Southern tip, Maa Shakti performed penance and waited for Bhagwan Shiva, who was residing in the Himalayas at the northernmost parts of Bharat. Kanniyakumari is the land of confluences. The sacred rivers of our country flow into different seas, and here, those very seas converge. And here, we witness another great confluence—the ideological confluence of Bharat! Here, we find the Vivekananda Rock Memorial, a grand statue of Saint Thiruvalluvar, Gandhi Mandapam, and Kamarajar Mani Mandapam. These streams of thought from these stalwarts converge here to form a confluence of national thought. This gives rise to great inspirations for nation-building. This land of Kanniyakumari gives an indelible message of unity, especially to any person who doubts Bharat’s nationhood and the sense of unity. The grand statue of Saint Thiruvalluvar in Kanniyakumari seems to be looking at the expanse of Maa Bharati from the sea. His work Thirukkural is one of the crown jewels of the beautiful Tamil language. It covers every aspect of life, inspiring us to give our best for ourselves and for the nation. It was my great fortune to pay my respects to such a great figure. Friends, Swami Vivekananda once said, ‘Every nation has a message to deliver, a mission to fulfil, a destiny to reach.’ For thousands of years, Bharat has been moving forward with this sense of meaningful purpose. Bharat has been a cradle of ideas for thousands of years. We have never considered what we have acquired as our personal wealth or measured it purely by economic or material parameters. Therefore, ‘Idam-na-mama’ (this is not mine) has become an inherent and natural part of the character of Bharat. Bharat’s welfare benefits our planet’s journey to progress as well. Take the freedom movement as an example. Bharat gained independence on August 15, 1947. At that time, many countries around the world were under colonial rule. Bharat’s independence journey inspired and empowered many of those countries to achieve their own freedom. That same spirit was seen decades later when the world came face to face with the once in a century COVID-19 pandemic. When concerns were raised about the poor and developing countries, Bharat’s successful efforts provided courage and assistance to many nations. Today, Bharat’s governance model has become an example for many countries around the world. Empowering 25 crore people to rise above poverty in just 10 years is unprecedented. Innovative practices such as Pro-People Good Governance, aspirational districts, and aspirational blocks are being discussed globally today. Our efforts, from empowering the poor to last-mile delivery, have inspired the world by prioritizing individuals standing at the last rung of society. Bharat’s Digital India campaign is now an example for the entire world, showing how we can use technology to empower the poor, bring transparency, and ensure their rights. Inexpensive data in Bharat is becoming a means of social equality by ensuring the reach of information and services to the poor. The whole world is witnessing and studying the democratization of technology, and major global institutions are advising many countries to adopt elements from our model. Today, Bharat’s progress and rise are not just a significant opportunity for Bharat alone, but also a historic opportunity for all our partner countries around the world. Since the success of the G-20, the world has been increasingly envisioning a bigger role for Bharat. Today, Bharat is being acknowledged as a strong and important voice of the Global South. The African Union has become a part of the G-20 group at the initiative of Bharat. This is going to be a crucial turning point for the future of African countries. Friends, The development trajectory of Bharat fills us with pride and glory, but at the same time, it also reminds the 140 crore citizens of their responsibilities. Now, without wasting a single moment, we must step forward towards greater duties and larger goals. We need to dream new dreams, convert them into reality and begin living those dreams. We must see Bharat’s development in a global context, and for this, it is essential that we understand Bharat’s internal capabilities. We must acknowledge Bharat’s strengths, nurture them, and utilize them for the benefit of the world. In today’s global scenario, Bharat’s strength as a youthful nation is an opportunity from which we must not look back. The world of the 21st century is looking towards Bharat with many hopes. And we will need to make several changes to move forward in the global scenario. We also need to change our traditional thinking regarding reform. Bharat cannot limit reform to just economic reforms. We must move forward in every aspect of life towards the direction of reform. Our reforms should also align with the aspirations of a ‘Viksit Bharat’ (developed India) by 2047. We must also understand that reform can never be a unidimensional process for any country. Therefore, I have laid out the vision of reform, perform, and transform for the country. The responsibility of reform lies with leadership. Based on that, our bureaucracy performs, and when the people join in with the spirit of Jan Bhagidari, we witness a transformation taking place. We must make excellence the fundamental principle to make our country a ‘Viksit Bharat’. We need to work quickly in all four directions: Speed, Scale, Scope, and Standards. Alongside manufacturing, we must also focus on quality and adhere to the mantra of ‘zero defect-zero effect’. Friends, We should take pride in every moment that God has blessed us with birth in the land of Bharat. God has chosen us to serve Bharat and fulfil our role in our country’s journey towards excellence. We must redefine our heritage in a modern way while embracing ancient values in a modern context. As a nation, we also need to reassess outdated thinking and beliefs. We need to free our society from the pressure of professional pessimists. We must remember that freedom from negativity is the first step towards achieving success. Success blossoms in the lap of positivity. My faith, devotion, and belief in the infinite and eternal power of Bharat are growing day by day. Over the past 10 years, I have seen this capability of Bharat grow even more and have experienced it firsthand. Just as we utilized the fourth and fifth decades of the 20th century to impart a new momentum to the freedom movement, we must lay the foundation for a ‘Viksit Bharat’ in these 25 years of the 21st century. The freedom struggle was a time that called for great sacrifices. The present times call for great and sustained contributions from everyone. Swami Vivekananda had said in 1897 that we must dedicate the next 50 years solely for the nation. Exactly 50 years after this call, Bharat gained independence in 1947. Today, we have the same golden opportunity. Let’s dedicate the next 25 years solely for the nation. Our efforts will create a strong foundation for the coming generations and the coming centuries, taking Bharat to new heights. Looking at the energy and enthusiasm of the country, I can say that the goal is not far away now. Let us take swift steps...let us come together and create a Viksit Bharat. - These thoughts were penned by PM Modi on 1st June between 4:15 PM and 7 PM during his return flight from Kanniyakumari to Delhi. Prime Minister Narendra Modi

Mr. Naidu said the exit polls pointed to a clear edge the opposition parties had over the YSRCP, and a successful comeback bid of the NDA at the Centre. He observed that the YSRCP created a ruckus over the postal ballots with mala fide intentions, and its attempt was thwarted by the State High Court. The chief counting agents and their teams should see to it that the officials strictly followed the norms related to counting. Further, Mr. Naidu said there was no room for complacency till the counting was completed, and wanted caution to be exercised during the shifting of EVMs to the counting centres. BJP election in-charge of Andhra Pradesh Arun Singh said the exit polls predicted NDA allies’ victory in 21 Lok Sabha constituencies and that their vote share would be 53%. BJP State president Daggubati Purandeswari and JSP political affairs committee chairman Nadendla Manohar apprehended trouble on the counting day, and advised the candidates to be prepared with the respective legal teams to fight any injustice.

In view of the high stakes involved in Tirupati district and the spate of violent incidents witnessed after the polling day on the university campus, the authorities concerned have done everything possible to ensure high security at the counting centre. Superintendent of Police V. Harshavardhan Raju, while addressing a meeting of officials deployed for counting, here, on June 2 (Sunday), minced no words while speaking on the strict frisking measures one has to undergo before being allowed into the counting hall. There are seven cut-off points at the inner cordon where the visiting personnel will be frisked through hand-held and door-frame metal detectors. “Apart from the authorisation letters issued by the Returning Officer, the police personnel on duty should ensure that the counting staff and agents of political parties mandatorily carry an original identity card before allowing their entry,” the SP said. Mobile phones will be allowed only for the Observers, Returning Officers, Assistant Returning Officers, ETPB operators. For others, pens, water bottles, spy cameras, button cameras, mobile phones and other forms of electronic gadgets will not be allowed. As a glaring chink in the armour, the varsity’s compound wall behind the strongroom opens into the road leading to Thummalagunta, which needs to be guarded extra cautiously in view of the recent entry of outsiders into the campus a day after the polling. Acknowledging the fact, Mr. Raju asked the police personnel to guard this area to prevent the entry of troublemongers. The police personnel have also been instructed to ensure the strict implementation of the prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the Cr.PC. The SP asked the police to use mild force, if required.

Barring the 2019 elections, Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Pema Khandu has won the “family constituency” uncontested thrice, the first time for the BJP ahead of the State’s Mandate 2024. In doing so, the 44-year-old established himself as the power centre in India’s easternmost State. “The BJP’s victory march in the country has begun from India’s Land of the Rising Sun,” he said after the BJP won 46 of the 60 seats, five more than in 2019. He credited the victory to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership and the pro-development pitch of his party. Mr. Khandu held various positions in Congress after joining it in 2000 but his political graph kept rising after he filled the void left behind by his father in Mukto. He became a Minister in Nabam Tuki’s Congress government and the BJP-supported government of Kalikho Pul after a constitutional crisis led to the imposition of President’s Rule in January 2016. The late Pul’s government was short-lived after the Supreme Court restored Mr. Tuki’s status as the Chief Minister. But the latter resigned and Mr. Khandu, then 37, succeeded him. Mr. Khandu’s political acumen became apparent three months into his term when he masterminded the defection of 43 Congress MLAs to the People’s Party of Arunachal (PPA), then an ally of the BJP. In December 2016, he joined the BJP along with most of the PPA legislators to hand the saffron party its second government in the State. He led the BJP to a big win in 2019 to continue in power, allegedly clipping the wings of many who tried to form coteries within the party. A history graduate from Delhi’s Hindu College, Mr. Khandu is a member of the Buddhist Monpa community that dominates Tawang and parts of West Kameng districts. He is credited with making Arunachal Pradesh a sports powerhouse in the northeast and is known to sing Kishore Kumar and Mohammad Rafi classics at official and cultural gatherings. In the run-up to the simultaneous Assembly and Lok Sabha polls on April 19, he promised a government that would be corruption-free, transparent, and people-centric. “As a disciplined party, the BJP can provide good governance,” he said, adding that the party leadership will decide who will head the government in Arunachal Pradesh after the Lok Sabha results are declared on June 4. Mr. Khandu later met Governor K.T. Parnaik and tendered his resignation along with his Council of Ministers. The Governor subsequently ordered the dissolution of the Assembly.

70.67% turnout in Odisha as voters line up to cast their ballots amid scorching heat,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/lok-sabha/odisha-records-6266-voter-turnout-in-the-last-phase-of-election/article68240315.ece,Odisha Chief Electoral Officer Nikunja Behari Dhal says the final voter turnout figure could touch 75% given the long queues of voters outside polling stations in the evening hours,"In the last phase of the election, Odisha recorded a voter turnout of 62.66% by 5 p.m. in six Lok Sabha constituencies in the coastal region of the State amid hot and humid conditions on Saturday. According to Nikunja Bihari Dhal, Chief Electoral Officer, Odisha, the final voter turnout figure could touch 75% given the long queues of voters seen before polling stations in the evening hours. The parliamentary seats that went to the polls were Mayurbhanj, Balasore, Bhadrak, Jajpur, Kendrapara and Jagatisinghpur. The fate of 66 candidates in six Parliamentary seats and 394 candidates in 42 Assembly seats got sealed in electronic voting machines (EVMs) in Odisha. The State’s coastal region is considered to be a stronghold of the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) and the party is struggling to retain its grip following strong anti-incumbency sentiments this time around. Regarding the Lok Sabha seats, the outcomes for former Union Ministers Srikant Jena and Pratap Sarangi, BJP national vice president Baijayant Panda, and senior BJD leader Rajashree Mallick have been determined and results will be announced on June 4.

Odisha BJP chief Manmohan Samal also sought election to the State assembly in the last phase. Addressing a press conference, Mr. Dhal said the four phases of elections in Odisha have been by and large peaceful with a 60% drop recorded in poll-related violence, violation in Model Code of Conduct (MCC) and electoral offences. In the last four phases of elections, total seizure of inducement including drugs, liquor and cash in Odisha was estimated at ₹280 crore. It includes cash seizure of ₹28.52 crore.

High stakes battle in Odisha between BJP and BJD,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/odisha-assembly/high-stakes-battle-in-odisha-between-bjp-and-bjd/article68236387.ece,"If re-elected, BJD supremo Naveen Patnaik would assume power for six straight terms and may become the longest serving CM in India’s history","The stakes are extremely high in Odisha for the the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Biju Janata Dal (BJD), particularly for Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, in the fiercely contested four-phase elections for both the Lok Sabha and the Assembly that will conclude on June 1. If re-elected, the Odisha CM, who has been in the role for 24 years, would assume power for the sixth term. He may go on to become India’s longest serving Chief Minister, surpassing former Sikkim CM Pawan Kumar Chamling’s record. The 77-year-old BJD chief, son of the late Biju Patnaik, did not have any experience in politics till he turned 50. Enjoying a stellar political career, he has never faced defeat in the Lok Sabha or Assembly elections. After a brief stint (1998 and 1999) as Union Steel Minister in the Cabinet of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Mr. Patnaik took oath as Odisha CM on March 5, 2000. Since then, he has not shown an interest in national politics, choosing to focus on the State instead. As a regional party, the BJD too has never been in out of power since its formation on December 26, 1997. Till 2009, both the BJD and the BJP remained in alliance. After the regional party severed its ties with the BJP just before the 2009 election over the issue of anti-Christian riots, the party has consistently won over 100 seats in the 147-member Odisha Assembly in 2009, 2014 and 2019 State elections. The party has also fared outstandingly in the Lok Sabha elections despite fighting solo after 2009. FOLLOW |India General Election 2024 LIVE updates - June 1 In the history spanning over more than two and half decades, the BJD is arguably facing its toughest electoral challenge in the current elections, struggling to replicate its past remarkable performances in the face of a strong wave of anti-incumbency. For the BJP, this election represents perhaps their best opportunity to capture an unconquered State despite repeated efforts in the past. Prime Minister Narendra Modi reportedly enjoys the highest approval ratings in this eastern Indian State, further buoying the party’s prospects. Adding to their optimism is a strong undercurrent of dissatisfaction with the ruling party. However, in the lead-up to the elections, the BJP squandered a critical two weeks negotiating an alliance with the BJD, which led to loss of momentum against a party that has held power for 24 consecutive years. Recovering from a temporary setback, the State BJP shifted into top gear, mobilising vast resources at its disposal and leaders from the central pool helmed by Mr. Modi and Union Home Ministers. Quite a good number of Union Ministers camped in the State recently to give a last big push to the party’s aspirations. For the Congress, the elections also assume significance in its bid to stay afloat and prevent itself from becoming a non-entity in the Odisha political landscape. In the BJP-BJD campaign war, V.K. Pandian, a close aide of Mr. Patnaik, who entered politics after voluntarily retiring from the Indian Administrative Service, became the primary target of the BJP. The party crafted its central campaign theme around his Tamil origin, aggressively pushing the narrative that he would succeed Odisha CM. The election strategy emphasised ‘Odia asmita (pride)’, focusing on the influence of the bureaucrat-turned-politician in Odisha’s governance and the BJD’s internal matters. BJP leader and Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan returned to direct elections in his home State after a gap of 15 years. He has earned a name for himself as an election strategist for the BJP over the past decade, winning a plum portfolio in the Cabinet. A victory from the Sambalpur Lok Sabha seat would help him strengthen his position in the party while a loss could dent his reputation. Odisha Assembly Elections 2024

An Odisha fortress and a hard electoral battle,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/an-odisha-fortress-and-a-hard-electoral-battle/article68237125.ece,The poll battle in Odisha could be tough for Naveen Patnaik with the BJP’s aggressive plan for a decisive electoral presence,"In modern India, no other political party has been as consistently aggressive as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been election after election in its campaign to expand its social base to all corners of India including Odisha. Not surprisingly, the State has witnessed a campaign blitzkrieg by the BJP’s tall leaders, which includes Prime Minister Narendra Modi who addressed a few meetings just a couple of days before May 13, the first phase of elections in Odisha. With a consistent decline in its social base, with nine seats out of 147 (Assembly seats) and one in Parliament in the 2019 elections, the Congress party, traditionally a dominant force, has now become an insignificant player. On the other hand, the BJP’s voteshare is at 38.4%, winning eight out of 21 seats in the 2019 parliamentary election, while the ruling Biju Janata Dal (BJD) led by Naveen Patnaik has 42.8%, winning 12 seats. In the 2019 Assembly elections, the voteshare of the BJP was 32.49 % and that of the BJD, 44.71%, respectively. Clearly, the gap between the two parties is closing with each election. For years, Mr. Patnaik maintained that the BJD’s policy has been to keep an equi-distance from the BJP and the Congress. But his party has conducted itself more as a loyal coalition partner to the Modi government than being independent. Further, the two parties did have discussions to jointly fight the 2024 election, but it did not work out. Set up in 1997, the BJD did have an alliance with the BJP that ended prior to the 2009 elections — the reason being the role of Hindutva right groups in the anti-Christian violence in Kandhamal in 2008 that received global attention. In interviews to the media, an otherwise reticent Mr. Patnaik has often described the BJP to be a communal party, but has never defined his secular politics and positioning against the BJP. Most of the time, and despite being the Odisha chief minister for five terms, Mr. Patnaik has behaved like an astute pragmatist and never nurtured national ambitions like many an Opposition Chief Minister elsewhere. In his long rule of 25 years, there was the shadow of two super Chief Ministers: Pyari Mohan Mohapatra, till they fell out, and now V.K. Pandian who is leading the 2024 campaign. The BJD’s decision in 2009 to end the alliance with the BJP was taken by Pyari Mohan Mahapatra. Those who compare Mr. Patnaik’s style of governance with Mr. Modi’s Gujarat days (when Mr. Modi was the Chief Minister there), need to recognise the point that Mr. Modi never had a super Chief Minister. For the BJP, the Hindu-Muslim polarisation strategy barely works in Odisha. At roughly around 2%, the Muslim population is insignificant and lives in a few clusters such as Cuttack, Kendrapara, Bhadrak, and Sungra. In Odisha, out of the 147 Assembly seats, not a single Assembly constituency is Muslim majority. Yet, during the 1980s and 1990s, there were four Muslim MLAs, who served as Ministers under the Congress and Janata party governments. But there have been none in Mr. Patnaik’s tenure. Additionally, the cult of Jagannath that has been central to Odiya identity has restrained the Ram Mandir movement. Mr. Modi, Amit Shah and J.P. Nadda appear to have recognised this, which is why their speeches in the campaign had evocations of ‘Jai Jagannath’. Several commentators, which includes Mr. Modi, are baffled by how Mr. Patnaik, despite not being well-versed with even elementary Odiya language, has been able to govern Odisha for so long. Odisha has had the distinction of many firsts. It was the first State in India to have been created on the basis of language. There was a separate Odisha movement which was triggered by a Bengali writer, who wrote ‘Odiya ekta Bhasha Naye (Odiya is not a language’). The separate Odisha movement was led by Madhusudan Das. Mr. Patnaik has pulled along because he is the son of Biju Patnaik, who, for many, is an iconic Oriya hero and epitome of Oriya nationalism. Those who are familiar with Biju Patnaik’s life during the 1940s and 1950s and his role in the Second World War or in the Indonesian freedom struggle at the behest of Jawaharlal Nehru, would be in awe of his stature. Given his contribution to the anti-Emergency movement in 1977 or his role in the installation of the V.P. Singh government in 1989, the description of his life as ‘dare-devil’ pilot (a line in The New York Times’s obituary) would be clearly inadequate. The BJP’s campaign this time has been far more aggressive compared to what it was in 2014 and 2019. It means the BJP will see a rise in vote share, but how it would translate into seats is hard to predict. Naveen babu, as Mr. Patnaik is called, is likely to return as Chief Minister, but there could be the sword of Damocles — of instability — that might hang over his head. Given the BJP’s hunger for power, Odisha might go the Maharashtra way, creating conditions for the BJP’s hegemony.

P.S. Tamang: A CM better known by his nickname,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sikkim/ps-tamang-a-cm-better-known-by-his-nickname/article68243553.ece,The Sikkim Krantikari Morcha calls Prem Singh Tamang the ‘Garib ka sarkar’,"GUWAHATI Local people refer to him as the ‘common man’s Chief Minister’ but chances are, they are more familiar with his nickname – Golay – than his official name. Golay is derived from Goley, a sub-clan of the Tamang community. Since 1985, a decade after the Buddhist kingdom of Sikkim was merged with India, politics in the State has been individual-driven. Nar Bahadur Bhandari’s Sikkim Sangram Parishad gave way to Pawan Kumar Chamling’s Sikkim Democratic Front (SDF), which yielded to Prem Singh Tamang’s Sikkim Krantikari Morcha (SKM) in 2019. Also Read:Sikkim Assembly elections 2024 | Key winners and losers The spotlight fell on Mr. Tamang when SKM ended Mr. Chamling’s reign as the Chief Minister for almost 25 years from 1994 to 2019. Mr. Tamang became a Minister in the Chamling-headed SDF government after winning his first election from the Soreng-Chakung constituency in West Sikkim in 1994. He continued as a Minister in the next two governments but fell out with Mr. Chamling after winning the 2009 Assembly election from the Burtuk seat. He came to be known as a rebel after going public against Mr. Chamling and was sidelined before he and other SDF dissidents formed the SKM in 2013. The SKM bagged 10 of the State’s 32 seats in the 2014 elections, finishing second behind the SDF. In January 2017, Mr. Tamang was disqualified after being convicted in December 2016 for misappropriating government funds in a cow distribution scheme while serving as the Animal Husbandry Minister from 1994-1999. He served a jail term from August 2017 till 2018 after the High Court of Sikkim and the Supreme Court upheld his conviction. The ‘rebel’ found a reason to devote his energy to forming an alternative government, eventually dislodging the SDF from power after the 2019 State polls. Mr. Tamang, who did not contest the election that year, was sworn in as the Chief Minister on May 27. Later, he won the byelection from the Poklok-Kamrang constituency by securing 84% of the votes. Apart from a slew of development and pro-poor measures such as a monthly pension of ₹2,000 for unmarried women, Mr. Tamang rode his charisma and oratory skill to be regarded as the “common man’s CM” while his SKM government came to be known as ‘Garib ka sarkar’ (government of the poor). Born in the West Sikkim district, Mr. Tamang graduated with a degree in humanities from West Bengal’s Darjeeling Government College in 1988. He joined a government school in 1990 as a teacher but quit the job three years later to pursue social work and politics. He was given a platform by the SDF, the very party he decimated three decades later, and followed it up with another landslide victory to extend his term, winning in two seats while doing so. The 56-year-old leader is expected to give up Rhenock, one of the two seats – the other is Soreng-Chakung – he won this time. Sikkim Assembly Elections 2024

Mr. Chamling lost to Sikkim Krantikari Morcha (SKM) candidate Raju Basnet by 2,256 votes in the Namcheybung seat. In the Poklok Kamrang Assembly constituency, he lost to Bhoj Raj Rai of SKM by 3,063 votes. Sikkim Assembly election 2024 results live updates According to the Election Commission of India data, the SKM won 19 Assembly seats and was leading in 12 other constituencies. Interestingly, Tenzing Norbu Lamtha, the lone SDF candidate who won the Shyari seat, switched over from SKM ahead of the Assembly polls after being denied a ticket. Pawan Kumar Chamling made history on April 29, 2018, when he became the longest-serving Chief Minister in the country after surpassing the record set by the late Jyoti Basu of West Bengal. The SDF supremo is a five-time Chief Minister with his party Sikkim Democratic Front winning the 1994, 1999, 2004, 2009, and 2014 Sikkim Legislative Assembly elections. He represented the Damthang constituency from 1985 to 1994 and the Namchi-Singhithang constituency in the Sikkim Legislative Assembly since 2019. Mr. Chamling started his political career at the age of 32. He served as a Minister under Nar Bahadur Bhandari’s Sikkim Sangram Parishad government from 1989 to 1992. He formed the Sikkim Democratic Front in March 1993. Mr. Chamling is also a poet and lyricist in the Nepali language. In the 2014 elections, the SKM surprised everyone by winning 10 of the 32 seats. Considering that in the 2004 and 2009 elections, the SDF won 31 and 32 seats respectively, the SKM’s result was a cause for concern for the SDF. However, defections eventually reduced the SKM’s representation in the State Assembly to just three members. In 2019, the seemingly invincible SDF suffered a dramatic defeat at the hands of the SKM led by Prem Singh Golay, a former SDF strongman and one-time close aide of Mr. Chamling. The SKM, riding on a “parivartan” (change) wave, won 17 of the 32 Assembly seats and the SDF secured 15 seats. While the SDF’s election plank was peace, stability, and development in the last 25 years, the SKM focussed on the rising anti-incumbency sentiment and allegations of corruption and nepotism against the ruling party. Explaining the possible reasons for losing in the 2019 Assembly polls, senior SDF leader and former Lok Sabha member Prem Das Rai toldFrontline: “There was a strong narrative for change, and there was a lag in our understanding and reaching out to the young generation, who did not understand the changes that the SDF brought about through development. There were also some inherent problems within the party. Ours is an old party and probably needs to adapt more quickly to the changing times in its style of functioning.” Mr. Chamling resigned as CM after the 2019 Sikkim Assembly election as Prem Singh’s SKM formed the government by winning 17 seats out of 32. SDF won the remaining 15 seats. Later in August 2019, 10 MLAs quit Mr. Chamling’s party to join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and in the same month, two other legislators joined SKM, making Mr. Chamling only MLA of the party.

New Sankalps from the Sadhana in Kanniyakumari,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/lok-sabha/new-sankalps-from-the-sadhana-in-kanniyakumari/article68244146.ece,None,"My fellow Indians, The biggest festival of democracy, the 2024 Lok Sabha Elections, are concluding today in our nation, the Mother of Democracy. After a three-day spiritual journey in Kanniyakumari, I have just boarded the plane for Delhi. Through the day, Kashi and numerous other seats have been in the midst of voting. My mind is filled with so many experiences and emotions... I feel a boundless flow of energy within myself. The 2024 Lok Sabha elections are the first in the Amrit Kaal. I began my campaign a few months ago from Meerut, the land of the First War of Independence of 1857. Since then, I have traversed across the length and breadth of our great nation. The final rally of these elections took me to Hoshiarpur in Punjab, the land of the great Gurus and a land associated with Sant Ravidas Ji. After that, I came to Kanniyakumari, at the feet of Maa Bharti. It is natural that the fervour of the elections was echoing in my heart and mind. The multitude of faces seen in rallies and road shows came in front of my eyes. The blessings from our Nari Shakti…the trust, the affection, all of this was a very humbling experience. My eyes were getting moist... I entered into a ‘sadhana’ (meditative state). And then, the heated political debates, the attacks and counter-attacks, the voices and words of accusations which are so characteristic of an election…they all vanished into a void. A sense of detachment came to grow within me...my mind became completely detached from the external world. Meditation becomes challenging amidst such huge responsibilities, but the land of Kanniyakumari and the inspiration of Swami Vivekananda made it effortless. As a candidate myself, I left my campaign in the hands of my beloved people of Kashi and came here. I am also grateful God for instilling me with these values from birth which I have cherished and tried to live up to. I was also thinking about what Swami Vivekananda must have experienced during his meditation at this very place in Kanniyakumari! A part of my meditation was spent in a similar stream of thoughts. Amidst this detachment, amidst the peace and silence, my mind was constantly thinking about the bright future of Bharat, the goals of Bharat. The rising sun at Kanniyakumari gave new heights to my thoughts, the vastness of the ocean expanded my ideas, and the expanse of the horizon continuously made me realize the unity, the Oneness, embedded in the depths of the universe. It seemed as if the observations and experiences undertaken in the lap of the Himalayas decades ago were being revived. Friends, Kanniyakumari has always been very close to my heart. The Vivekananda Rock Memorial in Kanniyakumari was built under the leadership of Shri Eknath Ranade ji. I had the opportunity to travel extensively with Eknath ji. During the construction of this Memorial, I had the opportunity to spend some time in Kanniyakumari as well. From Kashmir to Kanniyakumari... this is a common identity that is deeply ingrained in the heart of every citizen of the country. This is the ‘Shakti Peeth’ (seat of Shakti) where Maa Shakti incarnated as Kanya Kumari. At this Southern tip, Maa Shakti performed penance and waited for Bhagwan Shiva, who was residing in the Himalayas at the northernmost parts of Bharat. Kanniyakumari is the land of confluences. The sacred rivers of our country flow into different seas, and here, those very seas converge. And here, we witness another great confluence—the ideological confluence of Bharat! Here, we find the Vivekananda Rock Memorial, a grand statue of Saint Thiruvalluvar, Gandhi Mandapam, and Kamarajar Mani Mandapam. These streams of thought from these stalwarts converge here to form a confluence of national thought. This gives rise to great inspirations for nation-building. This land of Kanniyakumari gives an indelible message of unity, especially to any person who doubts Bharat’s nationhood and the sense of unity. The grand statue of Saint Thiruvalluvar in Kanniyakumari seems to be looking at the expanse of Maa Bharati from the sea. His work Thirukkural is one of the crown jewels of the beautiful Tamil language. It covers every aspect of life, inspiring us to give our best for ourselves and for the nation. It was my great fortune to pay my respects to such a great figure. Friends, Swami Vivekananda once said, ‘Every nation has a message to deliver, a mission to fulfil, a destiny to reach.’ For thousands of years, Bharat has been moving forward with this sense of meaningful purpose. Bharat has been a cradle of ideas for thousands of years. We have never considered what we have acquired as our personal wealth or measured it purely by economic or material parameters. Therefore, ‘Idam-na-mama’ (this is not mine) has become an inherent and natural part of the character of Bharat. Bharat’s welfare benefits our planet’s journey to progress as well. Take the freedom movement as an example. Bharat gained independence on August 15, 1947. At that time, many countries around the world were under colonial rule. Bharat’s independence journey inspired and empowered many of those countries to achieve their own freedom. That same spirit was seen decades later when the world came face to face with the once in a century COVID-19 pandemic. When concerns were raised about the poor and developing countries, Bharat’s successful efforts provided courage and assistance to many nations. Today, Bharat’s governance model has become an example for many countries around the world. Empowering 25 crore people to rise above poverty in just 10 years is unprecedented. Innovative practices such as Pro-People Good Governance, aspirational districts, and aspirational blocks are being discussed globally today. Our efforts, from empowering the poor to last-mile delivery, have inspired the world by prioritizing individuals standing at the last rung of society. Bharat’s Digital India campaign is now an example for the entire world, showing how we can use technology to empower the poor, bring transparency, and ensure their rights. Inexpensive data in Bharat is becoming a means of social equality by ensuring the reach of information and services to the poor. The whole world is witnessing and studying the democratization of technology, and major global institutions are advising many countries to adopt elements from our model. Today, Bharat’s progress and rise are not just a significant opportunity for Bharat alone, but also a historic opportunity for all our partner countries around the world. Since the success of the G-20, the world has been increasingly envisioning a bigger role for Bharat. Today, Bharat is being acknowledged as a strong and important voice of the Global South. The African Union has become a part of the G-20 group at the initiative of Bharat. This is going to be a crucial turning point for the future of African countries. Friends, The development trajectory of Bharat fills us with pride and glory, but at the same time, it also reminds the 140 crore citizens of their responsibilities. Now, without wasting a single moment, we must step forward towards greater duties and larger goals. We need to dream new dreams, convert them into reality and begin living those dreams. We must see Bharat’s development in a global context, and for this, it is essential that we understand Bharat’s internal capabilities. We must acknowledge Bharat’s strengths, nurture them, and utilize them for the benefit of the world. In today’s global scenario, Bharat’s strength as a youthful nation is an opportunity from which we must not look back. The world of the 21st century is looking towards Bharat with many hopes. And we will need to make several changes to move forward in the global scenario. We also need to change our traditional thinking regarding reform. Bharat cannot limit reform to just economic reforms. We must move forward in every aspect of life towards the direction of reform. Our reforms should also align with the aspirations of a ‘Viksit Bharat’ (developed India) by 2047. We must also understand that reform can never be a unidimensional process for any country. Therefore, I have laid out the vision of reform, perform, and transform for the country. The responsibility of reform lies with leadership. Based on that, our bureaucracy performs, and when the people join in with the spirit of Jan Bhagidari, we witness a transformation taking place. We must make excellence the fundamental principle to make our country a ‘Viksit Bharat’. We need to work quickly in all four directions: Speed, Scale, Scope, and Standards. Alongside manufacturing, we must also focus on quality and adhere to the mantra of ‘zero defect-zero effect’. Friends, We should take pride in every moment that God has blessed us with birth in the land of Bharat. God has chosen us to serve Bharat and fulfil our role in our country’s journey towards excellence. We must redefine our heritage in a modern way while embracing ancient values in a modern context. As a nation, we also need to reassess outdated thinking and beliefs. We need to free our society from the pressure of professional pessimists. We must remember that freedom from negativity is the first step towards achieving success. Success blossoms in the lap of positivity. My faith, devotion, and belief in the infinite and eternal power of Bharat are growing day by day. Over the past 10 years, I have seen this capability of Bharat grow even more and have experienced it firsthand. Just as we utilized the fourth and fifth decades of the 20th century to impart a new momentum to the freedom movement, we must lay the foundation for a ‘Viksit Bharat’ in these 25 years of the 21st century. The freedom struggle was a time that called for great sacrifices. The present times call for great and sustained contributions from everyone. Swami Vivekananda had said in 1897 that we must dedicate the next 50 years solely for the nation. Exactly 50 years after this call, Bharat gained independence in 1947. Today, we have the same golden opportunity. Let’s dedicate the next 25 years solely for the nation. Our efforts will create a strong foundation for the coming generations and the coming centuries, taking Bharat to new heights. Looking at the energy and enthusiasm of the country, I can say that the goal is not far away now. Let us take swift steps...let us come together and create a Viksit Bharat. - These thoughts were penned by PM Modi on 1st June between 4:15 PM and 7 PM during his return flight from Kanniyakumari to Delhi. Prime Minister Narendra Modi

"SIT report on poll-related violence soon, says IG Vineet Brijlal",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/sit-report-on-poll-related-violence-soon-says-ig-vineet-brijlal/article68243699.ece,"Out of 1,000 accused involved in 37 cases of riots, 650 have been arrested so far, he says","The Special Investigation Team (SIT) constituted to inquire into the poll-related violence cases in three districts has so far arrested about 650 accused, says its chief and SIB Inspector General of Police Vineet Brijlal. The State government had constituted SIT with 13 officers following violence during May 12 to 14. Police had registered 37 cases in Palnadu, Anantapur and Tirupati districts. Following violence on polling day (May 13) and on the following day, the police had registered cases in Narsaraopet, Macherla, Gurajala, Chandragiri, Tirupati and Tadipatri. “During investigation, we have observed that 1,370 accused are involved in the attacks. Of them, about 650 have been arrested. Besides, notices have been served under Section 41-A of the CrPC,” Mr. Brijlal told The Hindu. “We are coordinating with the Superintendents of Police (SPs) of the districts concerned.

In a letter to the West Bengal chief electoral officer on Saturday, BJP leader Shishir Bajoria said booth agents of the saffron party were driven out, CCTV cameras were found facing in directions other than the polling cubicle and voters were prevented from reaching booths. ""On behalf of Abhijit Das (Bobby), candidate of BJP of the Diamond Harbour Lok Sabha constituency, we request you to grant repolling in several booths"", the letter said.

"Undeterred by exit poll results, SP workers continue to guard EVMs in scorching heat",https://www.thehindu.com/elections/lok-sabha/undeterred-by-exit-poll-results-sp-workers-continue-to-guard-evms-in-scorching-heat/article68244209.ece,Party workers continued to work in shifts round-the-clock even as BJP and even Congress workers take a far less cautious approach,"The results of exit polls have not doused the enthusiasm of the Samajwadi Party workers as they continue to keep round-the-clock vigil at the strong rooms where the electronic voting machines (EVM) are stored, even as workers of the BJP are taking it easy. Exit polls have predicted 62-72 seats for the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and 6 to 17 seats for the INDIA bloc. SP spokesperson Abdul Hafiz Gandhi echoed the views of party president Akhilesh Yadav that the exit poll is based on the District Magistrate and not the EVM. Mr. Gandhi, who has been spending hours in the heat at the Kasganj strongroom of Etah Lok Sabha for almost a month, said that the “exit polls are not exact polls” and added that the party workers’ motivation to protect the EVMs from foul play has only doubled. The administration has issued two passes each per Assembly segment. “As Etah has five Assembly segments, we are ten people working in three shifts. There is a cooler to beat the heat and ludo to kill time. With no BJP and BSP workers around, we only have officials and policemen to discuss the trends and possible outcomes,” he said. Mr. Gandhi said the administration had provided them with the form 17C for all the booths and this was being shared with the counting agents. “We are sharing a docket that contains all the relevant information with counting agents and are training them to spot any attempt to sabotage the process on the day of counting,” he said. The strong rooms covered by the CCTV cameras are under the protection of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF). The party workers form the second layer. The outer layer of security is provided by the Uttar Pradesh Police. “There are three LED monitors outside on which the party workers keep an eagle eye. The administration has also provided a generator to keep the CCTV feed going in case of a power cut. Every vehicle that enters the premises is checked by the SP workers and every official has to sign a register before he enters the premises,” he said. In Budaun, Shafi Ahmad, vice president of Sewa Dal Youth Brigade of Uttar Pradesh, said the Congress workers are working with the SP to safeguard the EVMs. Budaun, where SP leader Shivpal Yadav’s son Aditya Yadav is in the fray, is one of those seats that the alliance expects to win by a margin of more than 50,000 votes, he said. He complained that on May 31, a major fault led to a power cut in five districts. The administration, he claimed, took three hours to restore the CCTV feed because the generator was not immediately available. “We have informed the party high command,” he said. Mr. Ahmed said the exit polls seemed sponsored and were meant to create an impression on the administration and kill the Opposition’s morale. It appears the Opposition is guarding EVMs at some seats more rigorously than others. In Ghaziabad, one found only one agent of an independent candidate keeping watch. He said the Congress workers visit once or twice a day but otherwise, it was just him. Interestingly, the BJP workers do not seem too keen on the security of the EVMs. Sanjay Narula, who is in charge of BJP’s election office in Rampur, said members visit the strong room occasionally but are not burning the midnight oil to safeguard the EVMs. “The SP workers are going overboard. We have faith in the administration,” he said. A senior BJP functionary in the Rampur office said the party is set to form the next government but it seems those who had conducted exit polls have gone overboard. “We could see three neck-to-neck fights around us in Rampur, Moradabad and Sambhal. It seems the pollsters have given all the close contests to the BJP.” General Elections 2024

pitched polls as a vote on democracy",https://www.thehindu.com/elections/lok-sabha/in-uttar-pradesh-bjp-focused-on-temple-opposition-pitched-polls-as-a-vote-on-democracy/article68244142.ece,"Akhilesh Yadav said the elections were a vote on India’s democracy and cautioned voters that if the BJP returned to power, they may introduce a law which will take rights from farmers and marginalised communities","The campaign for Uttar Pradesh, politically the most critical state, which elects 80 MPs to the lower house of parliament, saw the major political parties pitching their campaign agendas across the State in intense campaigning. The Bharatiya Janata Party concentrated on religious issues like the Ram Temple, and its nationalism pitch with the party’s well-oiled organisational machinery taking the narrative deep into the hinterland. The BJP also engineered robust social coalitions with Other Backward Classes (OBCs) caste centric sub-regional parties like the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) of Om Prakash Rajbhar, the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) of Jayant Chaudhary, Annupriya Patel’s Apna Dal (Sonelal), and NISHAD party of Sanjay Nishad in a bid to make sure nothing was left to chance. The Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Congress led a spirited campaign for the opposition INDIA bloc. It focused on issues such as economic anxiety, farmers distress, and alleged erosion of Constitutional and democratic institutions during BJP rule with leaders claiming that the 2024 polls were a vote to save Indian democracy which is under grave threat under the BJP dispensation. The Caste Census pitch also dominated the campaign vocabulary of the INDIA alliance. The broader rainbow alliance that the SP formed for the 2022 assembly polls with multiple sub-regional parties was missing in the Lok Sabha elections with two of its former allies, the RLD and the SBSP crossing over to the NDA. The BJP’s campaign pitch in U.P. had Ram Temple at the core with the Prime Minister Narendra Modi even claiming that the Congress and SP would bulldoze the temple if elected, adding that the opposition should learn from Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath where to use bulldozers.
“These parties (Congress and SP) disrespected Ram Lalla for decades and when after 500 years, the dream of a grand Ram Temple was fulfilled in Ayodhya, they rejected the invitation to the consecration ceremony. If the SP-Congress come to power, they will send Ram Lalla back to the tent and bulldoze the temple,” said the PM in a Barabanki rally. Mr. Modi even accused the two INDIA alliance parties of allying with forces who insult the people of U.P. The playbook of the SP and the Congress is dangerous. They seek votes here, but in south India, when their partners use abusive language to describe the people of U.P. and Sanatana Dharma, they remain silent,” the Prime Minister alleged, speaking in Janupur. Other top BJP leaders aggressively pitched the revocation of Article 370 in Kashmir, and India’s tough stand on terror. SP president Akhilesh Yadav said the elections were a vote on India’s democracy and cautioned voters that if the BJP returned to power, they may introduce a law which will take rights from farmers and marginalised communities like the Scheduled Caste (SC) and backwards.
“This 2024 Lok Sabha election is not only our election but also the election of the coming generations. Just like the Samudra manthan (churning of the ocean), this is an election to save the Constitution and democracy,” he said in many of his rallies. Mr. Yadav and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi pushed for a caste-based-census alleging that the BJP has deliberately avoided the caste census exercise as it is afraid of giving legitimate rights to backwards and marginalised sections. In Eastern and central U.P. which have sizeable OBC populations the issue was at the forefront of the INDIA alliance parties campaign pitch. The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) led by four-time U.P. CM Mayawati, once a formidable player in the electoral calculus of U.P. went solo. The party president was missing from campaigning for most of the election. She removed her heir apparent and nephew Akash Anand from key organisational posts in the middle of the elections. General Elections 2024

Before returning to Tihar Jail after the expiration of his 21-day interim bail, the Chief Minister urged counting agents of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) candidates to stay alert, alleging that the pollsters had released the fake numbers on the “instructions from the top”. “These exit polls are nothing but mind games to drive you into depression,” Mr. Kejriwal said, addressing AAP workers at the party headquarters. “You must remain there [at the counting centres] till the final counting is done to prevent any chances of manipulation in the election results. Five per cent of the VVPATs are matched with EVMs. If there is any discrepancy, we can expose their EVM scam,” he added. The exit polls, released on Saturday evening after the conclusion of the polling for the seventh and the last phase of the general election, predicted a third term for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, with a decisive victory for the NDA. Apart from Mr. Kejriwal, several leaders of the INDIA bloc have dismissed the predictions, claiming that the Opposition was set to form the next government at the Centre with at least 295 seats. Attacking the BJP over the predictions, the AAP chief said several “theories” about why the surveys indicated such a landslide victory for the NDA are doing rounds. “One of the theories is that their friends have invested money in the share market and if the market goes up as soon as it opens [on Monday], they can withdraw funds and earn a huge amount of money,” Mr. Kejriwal said. “According to the second theory, the exit poll numbers could have been manipulated to influence the poll outcome by putting pressure on election officers [on the day of counting].” “The third theory says the predictions aim at preventing a rebellion against Prime Minister Modi and [Home Minister] Amit Shah in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) before the declaration of the results,” the Chief Minister added.

"Wait for counting of votes, Akhilesh on exit poll surveys",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/wait-for-counting-of-votes-akhilesh-on-exit-poll-surveys/article68244298.ece,None,"Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday dismissed the predictions made in the exit polls — that the BJP-led NDA was on its way to a third consecutive term at the Centre — and asked candidates and polling agents of the Indian National Developmental, Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) bloc to keep a close watch on the Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) on the counting day. He said the exit polls had been prepared “months in advance” to help the BJP gain from stock markets on Monday, a day before the counting of votes. “The downcast look on the faces of the BJP leaders is revealing the truth about the results,” Mr. Yadav said. “The BJP leaders realise that the result of the whole country cannot be changed like it was done in the Chandigarh mayoral election because this time the Opposition is fully alert and public anger is at its peak,” the SP chief said in a post in Hindi on X. In the Chandigarh mayoral election held earlier this year in February, which AAP and Congress had fought together, the BJP candidate was declared the winner. However, the result was overturned after the Supreme Court stepped in, noting “brazen malpractices” in the election process. “The result will come from the counting of votes. Mann ki Baat does not apply here. This is about Jan ki Baat (public’s voice) and when the public is vigilant, people can’t do whatever they please,” he added. He reiterated that the Opposition will come to power at the Centre and advised INDIA bloc candidates to celebrate only after collecting their winning certificates. General Elections 2024

He said that he was waiting for the actual results to be declared on June 4. In response to the exit poll projections, he told presspersons that the INDIA leaders have declared their own numbers based on surveys from each State. While he did not reject the numbers shown by the exit polls, he emphasised that “the INDIA leaders have their own projections.” He also acknowledged that in a democracy, one party will win and another will lose in an election. He said that everyone is eagerly waiting for the actual results on June 4. The exit polls have brought joy to the ruling BJP in the State, with party supporters celebrating the predicted results in some places. Party State president Rajib Bhattacharjee confidently said that the party would win 400 seats in the Lok Sabha as projected by the exit polls. He expressed no doubt about the party’s ability to win both Lok Sabha seats in Tripura by a large margin. However, Congress leader and former Minister Sudip Roy Barman criticised the exit poll organisers and accused them of being hired to create confusion and manipulate the vote counting process. He said that the actual outcome of the polls would be the opposite of what has been projected on television channels. General Elections 2024

"Forsaken, marginalised and forgotten",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/forsaken-marginalised-and-forgotten/article68243990.ece,The diminishing space for a section of society in the electoral fray — the Muslim — is cause for concern,"Majoritarian nationalism is reshaping Indian politics. Declining minority participation, particularly Muslim representation, in the corridors of power is an inevitable consequence. The general election, that has just concluded, is a veritable testimony to India’s, at times enthusiastic, at others grudging, acceptance of hues of Hindu nationalism. Even as the wounds of a complete abnegation of Muslim representation in the outgoing government had not healed, a fresh stab was made at the idea of India. Muslim exclusion from electoral politics is beginning to sound real, central, and almost all pervasive. As we await the results to the 18th Lok Sabha, there is a cause for concern over the diminishing space for a section of society in the electoral fray. In the 2019 election, 115 Muslims had contested as the representatives of various political parties. This time, the number was 78, with many parties too timid to give a ticket to a Muslim candidate from anywhere except in the so-called Muslim dominated seats. It could be a reflection of our politics where a Muslim candidate is not preferred by some merely because of his or her faith. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, despite the noises made last year by Prime Minister Narendra Modi about Pasmanda Muslims, entered a sole Muslim, Abdul Salam, from Malappuram in Kerala. Otherwise, from Punjab to Tamil Nadu, Gujarat to Nagaland, the party deemed Muslims surplus to its electoral arithmetic. The Indian National Congress did not cover itself with glory either — the number of Muslim candidates fighting on the party symbol came down from 34 in 2019 to 19 this time. What was disconcerting was the party’s reluctance to put up even a single Muslim candidate from either Delhi or Mumbai, leading to noises of protest from the party leader Muhammad Arif Naseem Khan who said, “The party wants Muslim votes, not Muslim candidates.” Mr. Khan could as well have been speaking for most non-Bharatiya Janata Party parties. The Samajwadi Party, often criticised for being MY (Muslims and Yadavs) representative, fought on 62 seats in Uttar Pradesh but put up only four Muslims in the State where Muslims comprise 19% of population. Likewise, the Rashtriya Janata Dal in Bihar fielded only two Muslim candidates; however, its ally, the Congress, did give tickets to Muslim candidates from Katihar and Kishanganj. In Gujarat, neither the Congress nor the BJP put up a Muslim candidate. The story of Muslim denial was repeated by both parties in Rajasthan. In Bengal, the Trinamool Congress, despite Mamata Banerjee’s robust defence of minority rights, gave tickets to only six Muslim candidates out of the 42 seats it contested in the State. Significantly, Muslims account for a little over 27% of the State’s population. Bengal presents a microcosm of the country. This under-nomination is bound to result in under-representation in Parliament. The community looks at the bleak prospect of sending possibly its lowest number of Members of Parliament to the Lok Sabha when the results are announced on June 4. Forsaken, marginalised, and, probably forgotten. All this is a far cry from the heydays of the 1980s when Muslims enjoyed a sizeable slice of the electoral cake. In 1980, there were 49 Muslim MPs in the Lok Sabha. In 1984, there were 46 Muslim MPs. Pertinently, the BJP was just born in 1980 and had only two Lok Sabha MPs in 1984. As the party’s fortunes rose in ensuing elections, the fortunes of the largest minority went into a parallel decline, finishing with only 23 MPs in 2014. There was a token increase of three in 2019 — a number that seems difficult to attain this time in the light of a drastic fall in the number of Muslim candidates. The Muslim MP is faced with the prospect of gradual elimination. Muslims bring up a little over 14% of India’s population, but since the first election in 1951-52 to the last round in 2019, the community’s share in Lok Sabha has been under 6%. Incidentally, while Muslims have not been as visible as candidates this time, this, however, has not translated into their absence from headlines during the elections. Mr. Modi led the pack in stoking fears in the larger society, referring to the community members as “infiltrators” or “the Congress seeking to give a buffalo to a Muslim if a Hindu owned two buffaloes” to give an example or two. He was both coarse and divisive. If the data shared by the Congress president, Mallikarjun Kharge, are to be believed, Mr. Modi used the term ‘Mandir-Masjid-Muslim’ 421 times in his speeches. For all his bluff and bluster, he did not conceal his irreverence for the idea of India — a value system that regards all citizens as equal stakeholders in the progress of the nation. Mr. Modi’s aggressive Hindutva set the benchmark for other parties. Forget the so-called Muslim vote-bank politics of yesteryears. Today, even the Centrist and Left parties remain disinclined to end Muslim political isolation. The demographic profiles of the contestants to the 18th Lok Sabha could be a nod to Mr. Modi’s concept of Bharat. Indian democracy, however, will be better served without taints of such exclusion. ziya.salam@thehindu.co.in General Elections 2024

For a consensus: On campaigning rhetoric and foreign policy,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/for-a-consensus-the-hindu-editorial-on-campaigning-rhetoric-and-foreign-policy/article68242810.ece,Elections should not prompt politicians to break the consensus on foreign policy,"With the curtains coming down on the general election 2024, every party will take stock of its campaign on issues of domestic political importance. However, it is also necessary for all concerned, particularly those forming the next government, to review the disturbing trend of revisiting questions of foreign policy. Both sides have ratcheted up the rhetoric over India’s international ties and in some cases, even the re-opening of settled bilateral agreements. At the start of the campaign, the ruling party focused on the issue of the half-century-old Katchatheevu agreement, that accepted the island as Sri Lankan territory, to target the Opposition Congress and the DMK that were in power in 1974. In response, Congress leaders asked whether the 2015 Land Boundary Agreement with Bangladesh could also be reviewed for its land concessions. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has led the charge on other foreign policy fronts, especially on Pakistan, calling the Congress party a “disciple of Pakistan” and comparing its manifesto pejoratively to that of the Muslim League that founded Pakistan. U.P. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath even proclaimed that were Mr. Modi to be re-elected, he would reclaim Pakistan Occupied Kashmir “within six months”. Other brash comments over India’s use of its nuclear arsenal, or that the government will transgress international boundaries to kill ‘terrorists threatening India’, have raised eyebrows in many capitals. The clashes between the Indian Army and Chinese PLA at Galwan in 2020 that led to the deaths of 20 soldiers have often been raised by Opposition leaders in campaign rallies, as in the past as well. Meanwhile, throughout the campaign, Mr. Modi and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar accused “western powers” of attempting to interfere in Indian polls. Such heated campaign rhetoric is meant for domestic audiences, but it would be unwise for political leaders to assume that India’s international partners are not watching and listening carefully. India’s ties with its smaller neighbours carry the highest levels of sensitivity, and raking up these issues and exposing India’s vulnerable faultlines, just to make political capital, seems short-sighted. While domestic policy has always been deeply divisive, India’s polity had for long achieved a bipartisanship when it came to foreign policy positions, and often took pride in the deployment of Opposition leaders to defend India’s case worldwide, including at the UN. The proper platform for the government to assert foreign policy, or for the Opposition to air its differences with it, is not the hustings, but Parliament. It is hoped that as the dust settles, leaders will reflect on the potential damage to India’s credibility from campaign propaganda, and restore a more enduring consensus on international relations.

YSRCP moves Supreme Court against EC on relaxation of postal ballot norms,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/ysrcp-moves-supreme-court-against-ec-on-relaxation-of-postal-ballot-norms/article68244446.ece,"The plea directs the court’s attention to the procedure governing the casting, verification and counting of postal ballots","The YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) moved the Supreme Court urgently on Sunday against the Election Commission (EC), questioning the validity of around five lakh postal ballots cast in the State of Andhra Pradesh. A Vacation Bench of Justices Sandeep Mehta and Aravind Kumar is likely to hear the case on Monday. The party has challenged the State High Court’s refusal to consider on merits its plea against the relaxation of postal ballot norms by the poll body. The High Court had dismissed the plea on the sole basis that there was an alternate remedy available, that is, to file an election petition. The petition, filed by advocate Mahfooz A. Nazki, said the postal ballots cast form 1.5% of the total votes. “It is important to note that the results of Assembly as well as Parliamentary constituencies are scheduled to be declared on June 4. In the event invalid votes are taken into account, the same is bound to cause grave prejudice to the petitioner (YSRCP),” the petition highlighted. The plea directs the court’s attention to the procedure governing the casting, verification and counting of postal ballots envisaged under Conduct of Election Rules 1961 and the instructions issued in July 19 last year by the EC read with Form 13A of the 1961 Rules. Rules 23 and 24 prescribe the form in which postal ballot votes are to be processed. Form 13A is to be signed in the presence of an authorised officer who also has to attest to the signature. The declaration that is duly attested is to be kept in a cover marked as Form 13A. Thereafter, the said officer is necessarily required to put his designation, signature, and seal in the Form 13A. Rule 54A(4) mandates that an unsigned or unattested Form 13A should be rejected. “From the above, it is clear that this procedure is sine qua non for a postal ballot to be treated as valid,” the petition said. However, the YSRCP said a EC circular issued on May 30, 2024 had relaxed the postal ballot norms. The party said the circular was made applicable only to Andhra Pradesh. “Strangely, the EC issued the impugned circular dated 30.05.2024 only in respect of the State of Andhra Pradesh providing that even if Form 13A only contains the signature of the attesting officer, the same is to be accepted…The action of the Election Commission is ex-facie unsustainable,” the party contended. The circular was issued 17 days from the date of elections which took place in Andhra Pradesh on May 13. “It therefore raises suspicions regarding the motives behind the circular,” the appeal said. YSRCP said it was not trying to impede the election process through this petition challenging a circular. “The challenge is made to ensure a free and fair election process,” it noted.

P.S. Tamang: A CM better known by his nickname,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sikkim/ps-tamang-a-cm-better-known-by-his-nickname/article68243553.ece,The Sikkim Krantikari Morcha calls Prem Singh Tamang the ‘Garib ka sarkar’,"GUWAHATI Local people refer to him as the ‘common man’s Chief Minister’ but chances are, they are more familiar with his nickname – Golay – than his official name. Golay is derived from Goley, a sub-clan of the Tamang community. Since 1985, a decade after the Buddhist kingdom of Sikkim was merged with India, politics in the State has been individual-driven. Nar Bahadur Bhandari’s Sikkim Sangram Parishad gave way to Pawan Kumar Chamling’s Sikkim Democratic Front (SDF), which yielded to Prem Singh Tamang’s Sikkim Krantikari Morcha (SKM) in 2019. Also Read:Sikkim Assembly elections 2024 | Key winners and losers The spotlight fell on Mr. Tamang when SKM ended Mr. Chamling’s reign as the Chief Minister for almost 25 years from 1994 to 2019. Mr. Tamang became a Minister in the Chamling-headed SDF government after winning his first election from the Soreng-Chakung constituency in West Sikkim in 1994. He continued as a Minister in the next two governments but fell out with Mr. Chamling after winning the 2009 Assembly election from the Burtuk seat. He came to be known as a rebel after going public against Mr. Chamling and was sidelined before he and other SDF dissidents formed the SKM in 2013. The SKM bagged 10 of the State’s 32 seats in the 2014 elections, finishing second behind the SDF. In January 2017, Mr. Tamang was disqualified after being convicted in December 2016 for misappropriating government funds in a cow distribution scheme while serving as the Animal Husbandry Minister from 1994-1999. He served a jail term from August 2017 till 2018 after the High Court of Sikkim and the Supreme Court upheld his conviction. The ‘rebel’ found a reason to devote his energy to forming an alternative government, eventually dislodging the SDF from power after the 2019 State polls. Mr. Tamang, who did not contest the election that year, was sworn in as the Chief Minister on May 27. Later, he won the byelection from the Poklok-Kamrang constituency by securing 84% of the votes. Apart from a slew of development and pro-poor measures such as a monthly pension of ₹2,000 for unmarried women, Mr. Tamang rode his charisma and oratory skill to be regarded as the “common man’s CM” while his SKM government came to be known as ‘Garib ka sarkar’ (government of the poor). Born in the West Sikkim district, Mr. Tamang graduated with a degree in humanities from West Bengal’s Darjeeling Government College in 1988. He joined a government school in 1990 as a teacher but quit the job three years later to pursue social work and politics. He was given a platform by the SDF, the very party he decimated three decades later, and followed it up with another landslide victory to extend his term, winning in two seats while doing so. The 56-year-old leader is expected to give up Rhenock, one of the two seats – the other is Soreng-Chakung – he won this time. Sikkim Assembly Elections 2024

He often accompanied PM Modi in some of his rallies. In all, Yogi attended 204 election-related events in 61 days of his campaigning for the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. Modi, like in 2014 and 2019, started his poll campaign in UP by addressing a rally in Meerut, which went to the polls in the second phase.

The road shows were strategically planned and aimed to touch at least five organisational regions, including West UP, Braj, Awadh, Kanpur-Bundelkhand and Kashi. Modi's road shows in Varanasi and Ayodhya were categorically perceived to sharpen BJP's religious-cultural narrative, especially after the inauguration of Ram temple in Ayodhya. Shah, too, led two road shows - one in Amethi and the other in Ghazipur. Both these road shows, too, were part of BJP's deft planning to ratchet up the poll fervour in the two constituencies which the BJP seeks to win desperately. Shah also worked behind the curtains while holding key organisational meetings after each phase. Likewise, for the INDIA bloc, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav addressed nearly 83 solo public rallies besides five joint rallies with former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi and six road shows. Akhilesh criss-crossed the state by air as well as in his customised 'rath' to meet his party supporters. In between, he held meetings with his party leaders - both sitting and ex-MLAs - seeking ground-level feedback. Even his wife and Mainpuri MP Dimple Yadav campaigned hectically till Thursday.

He remarked that the people are strongly supporting Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision for a viksit ( developed ) and aatmanirbhar ( self-reliant ) Bharat. Addressing reporters after casting his vote in the last phase of the Lok Sabha elections on Saturday morning, Yogi said: ""The final phase of the Lok Sabha Elections 2024, is taking place today across 57 seats in 8 states. This includes 13 seats in eastern Uttar Pradesh : Maharajganj, Gorakhpur, Deoria, Kushinagar, Bansgaon, Salempur, Ballia, Ghosi, Robertsganj, Ghazipur, Varanasi, Chandauli, and Mirzapur.""

They presented the work and achievements of their govts. “To elect the new govt, people have done a comparative analysis of the performances of the previous govts and the Modi govt in the last 10 years. Considering the support received across the nation, it can be said that when the results will come on June 4, those individuals, parties, and govts that have worked towards a self-reliant and developed India, preserving heritage while fostering development, showing compassion for the poor, and ensuring a bright future for the youth, will receive full support,” he said. Yogi said over the past 10 years, everyone has witnessed a changing India, and in the last 7 years, they have seen a new Uttar Pradesh under the double-engine govt. “Under PM Modi's leadership, work was done for the youth, farmers, businessmen, women, and every section of society with a spirit of security, respect, and development,” he said. Yogi expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the voters for their enthusiasm despite the soaring mercury. He added, ""To make the country the world's third-largest economy in the next three years and to bring prosperity, the people's blessings are with PM Modi and the BJP."" Yogi further mentioned that under PM’s leadership, the govt has undertaken unprecedented work for the safety, respect, and self-reliance of women. The CM told young voters that they should actively participate in the campaign to advance the new India, which is equipped with excellent infrastructure and earning respect globally. He also cautioned young voters against parties and individuals trying to mislead them. ""Our future is bright with the goal of a self-reliant and developed India, and the youth should cast their votes with this goal in mind,” he said. Yogi said, “PM Modi has recognized only four castes-youth, poor, women, and farmers-and has their complete support.” Adityanath also responded to the statements being made by the leaders of opposition parties on the spiritual-nation worship of PM. In response to a question asked in this regard, he said the spiritual worship of PM, who serves Mother India tirelessly, without wavering, without stopping, is completely a worship of the nation. But those who are involved in pleasures ('bhog'), corruption ('bhrashtachar'), incest ('anachar') and misconduct ('durachar'), cannot understand the importance of spiritual worship. On the review meeting of INDIA bloc leaders, CM said it is good that they sit together before June 4 because after the results there will be many disputes where they will blame, and insult each other. Responding to questions raised by SP workers during the controversy over arrangement of EVM protection before counting, he said, “Those who did not find candidates for 80 seats in the state are bound to blame someone or the other. These people have become tired of blaming EVMs. Now, by accusing the Election Commission, they are undermining the atmosphere of democracy.” He said that the EC is conducting the process with complete impartiality, transparency, and honesty. Wherever there were some complaints, the commission took prompt action. However, the SP has no faith in democracy. They have always insulted the Constitution made by BR Ambedkar. “Democracy sounds ridiculous coming from the mouths of those who give space to mafias and terrorists. For SP, it can only be said, as you sow, so shall you reap,” Yogi said.",Times of India,India

Also See : Exit Poll 2024 Live Update The 2024 general election was held in Uttar Pradesh in all seven phases from April 19 to June 1 to elect 80 members of the 18th Lok Sabha , with the results to be declared on June 4. Uttar Pradesh, along with Bihar and West Bengal, were the only states where the 2024 Lok Sabha election were held in all 7 phases. A total of 80 parliamentary constituencies were up for grabs, making Uttar Pradesh the single largest contributor to the Lok Sabha. The road to Delhi is said to pass through Lucknow, underscoring the pivotal role Uttar Pradesh plays in shaping the national political landscape. With 63 unreserved seats and 17 reserved for Scheduled Caste candidates, the state's electoral significance cannot be overstated. In the previous parliamentary elections of 2019, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) emerged victorious, clinching 63 seats, while the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) secured 9, the Samajwadi Party (SP) 5, and the Congress managed to capture just 1 seat. The BJP 's dominance in the state has been notable, with its victory in 2019 marking the second consecutive landslide win under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In a bid to counter the BJP juggernaut, the opposition parties this year have been strategizing intensely. The Congress and the Samajwadi Party have forged an alliance, with the Congress set to contest 17 seats while the rest will be contested by the SP. The resurgent BJP, buoyed by its consecutive victories in 2014 and 2019, has been leaving no stone unturned to maintain its stronghold in Uttar Pradesh. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership and the party's organizational machinery have been instrumental in consolidating its position ahead of the 2024 elections. As the electorate gears up to exercise their democratic right, the battle lines have been drawn, and the stage is set for a nail-biting contest that could redefine the political landscape of Uttar Pradesh and, by extension, the nation itself. The total number of constituencies in Uttar Pradesh are 80. The full list of constituencies are as follows- Agra, Akbarpur, Aligarh, Allahabad, Ambedkar Nagar, Amethi, Amroha, Aonla, Azamgarh, Badaun, Baghpat, Bahraich, Ballia, Banda, Bansgaon, Barabanki, Bareilly, Basti, Bhadohi, Bijnor, Bulandshahr, Chandauli, Deoria, Dhaurahra, Domariyaganj, Etah, Etawah, Faizabad, Farrukhabad, Fatehpur, Fatehpur Sikri, Firozabad, Gautam Buddha Nagar, Ghaziabad, Ghazipur, Ghosi, Gonda, Gorakhpur, Hamirpur, Hardoi, Hathras, Jalaun, Jaunpur, Jhansi, Kairana, Kaiserganj, Kannauj, Kanpur, Kaushambi, Kheri, Kushi Nagar, Lalganj, Lucknow, Machhlishahr, Maharajganj, Mainpuri, Mathura, Meerut, Mirzapur, Misrikh, Mohanlalganj, Moradabad, Muzaffarnagar, Nagina, Phulpur, Pilibhit, Pratapgarh, Rae Bareli, Rampur, Robertsganj, Saharanpur, Salempur, Sambhal, Sant Kabir Nagar, Shahjahanpur, Shrawasti, Sitapur, Sultanpur, Unnao, Varanasi.

Normally though, apart from the noise of the constant movement of heavy vehicles in and out of its factories and plants, the region remains mostly calm. Talk of a change, however, is getting louder as Robertsganj Lok Sabha constituency is set for polls on Saturday. Robertsganj, the headquarters of Sonbhadra district, has five assembly segments — Ghorawal, Obra, Duddhi, Robertsganj and Chakia — and an electorate of 17.8 lakh.

I believe change is needed at this juncture.” Politicians will not overlook Ramdev, member of a tribal community that forms 20% of the electorate in Sonbhadra. Tribal hamlets in the district account for 3.9 lakh of UP’s 11.3 lakh ST population per Census 2011. Gonds alone are 45% followed by Kharwars (21%). Only SCs (23%) outnumber tribals in Robertsganj and share the potential to tilt the scales in someone’s advantage. Chhanbey MLA Rinki Singh Kol , 36, of NDA constituent Apna Dal (S) is locked in a direct fight with Samajwadi Party’s Chhotelal Kharwar, 51, for the seat. BSP has fielded Dhaneshwar Gautam, a lawyer. Rinki is the daughter-in-law of Pakaudi Lal Kol, who was the Robertsganj MP in 2009 with SP and in 2019 with Apna Dal (S). Her husband Rahul died of cancer. The family enjoys the backing of their Kol SC community, which has about 75,000 votes here. After making embarrassing remarks against upper castes at a public meeting in Oct 2021, Pakaudi Lal had to sacrifice his ticket as Apna Dal (S) chief Anupriya Patel did not want to invite their wrath in Sonbhadra and her own seat of Mirzapur. Pakaudi Lal had earlier pushed for the candidature of his younger son Jagprakash instead of Rinki. “Kols have a sizeable population in Mirzapur and, hence, pleasing the community is important for Anupriya. Picking Rinki appears to be wise as it becomes easier to target women voters across various castes,” said Jagat Narayan Vishwakarma, a journalist from Renukoot. In 2014, Pakaudi Lal, contesting on an SP ticket, finished third behind Kharwar, then a BJP candidate, and Sharada Prasad (BSP). In 2019, BJP handed the seat to Apna Dal and Pakaudi Lal made a strong comeback by winning 45.3% votes. In 2022 state polls, BJP swept all five assembly segments of Robertsganj LS seat. Yadavs have 1.3 lakh votes and Muslims nearly 60,000. Along with anti-incumbency, Rinki has to worry about resentment among upper caste members against Pakaudi Lal. It becomes evident that folk singer Kharwar has been on song and the SP camp upbeat about their campaign. A dedicated BJP worker and former pradhan of his village, Kharwar became MP twice only to be denied a ticket in 2019. Shalik Patel, 34, a driver from Arauli village on the outskirts of Robertsganj, said: “The ‘barat ghar’ (community centre) that was opened in our gram sabha in Aug 2011 collapsed within a few months. Not a single wedding could be held there. Villagers are using the damaged building as a shelter home for cattle. Pakaudi Lal has been elected multiple times and has started taking things for granted. BJP should have fielded a new face instead of his ‘bahu’.” Shiv Mohan, 45, a dhobi and a father of four, runs a small grocery shop in Kota, a village on the road to Garhwa district in Jharkhand, which still has a Naxal presence. “A decade ago, it was not possible to move out after sunset as Naxals used to target the Kon-Garhwa route. Maoists have shifted out of Sonbhadra and we feel secure while commuting in the night though unemployment is a big worry here,” said Mohan. Dubbed as the energy capital of India as it produces more than 10,000 MW power, many villages in Sonbhadra are not yet connected to the power grid and don’t have mobile phone services. Moreover, industries and manufacturing units that exploit the natural resources of the region offer limited jobs to local youths. “Only a few lucky people get employment. Earlier, ‘baniyas’ and ‘seths’ avoided offering jobs to locals as they felt that people who stay in remote villages are Naxal sympathisers,” said Shalik Patel from Arauli. Though the Maoist movement has been suppressed in Sonbhadra, its shadow still looms over the region. Voting will end at 4pm in 504 of the 1,295 polling stations in Robertsganj as a “precautionary measure”. With almost 40% of the area covered by forest, it takes up to five hours to commute between two farthest villages in the district. Ram Bhog Gond, a private employee in late 20s who works at a leading hotel near Badhauli crossing in Robertsganj, says elected representatives should ensure local youths get preference in jobs. “Local bodies, MLAs and MPs together with factory owners must ensure that 15-20% of unskilled and non-technical roles that require manual labour are set aside for local youths. We are among the few tribal families that moved out of the village in search of jobs,” he said. Rinki said: “I do not speak a lot during public meetings and rallies as I don’t feel there is a lot to say. I’m working hard to win the seat for the NDA alliance in UP.” She admitted unemployment was a major issue, adding that she was determined to address it.",Times of India,India

Auctioning them for Rs 2,500-Rs 3,000 per quintal at APMC mandi would cover his expenses and, in good times, even fetch him a good profit. However, last Nov, unseasonal rains wreaked havoc as the crop was ready for harvest. All he could salvage from his 25 acres was a meagre 25 quintals. Then, before Kokane could recover from the blow, the Centre announced a ban on export of onions in the first week of Dec. “I was forced to sell off my stock for Rs 1,000 a quintal. It was a double whammy,” Ganesh said.

Even though it lifted the embargo later on, it did not help improve the wholesale prices,” he said. Now, he earns a paltry Rs 40 for unloading onions from farmers ’ tractors and loading them on to traders’ vehicles. He handles about 10-15 vehicles daily. Kokane’s is not an isolated case. Distress and anger are palpable among nearly 8 lakh voters who are directly or indirectly associated with onion cultivation in the Dindori LS seat, which comprises six assembly segments — Nandgaon , Kalwan, Yeola, Chandwad, Niphad, and Dindori. Voting here is on May 20. At the receiving end of the ire is BJP candidate and Union minister Bharati Pawar , who is under immense pressure to retain the seat that the saffron party has held since 2009. Shiv Sena MLA from Nandgaon, Suhas Kande, said Mahayuti bigwigs are working overtime to contain farmers’ resentment. “But in no way will (Bhaskar) Bhagare’s victory help stabilise prices. Organisationally, Mahayuti is strong and that alone will ensure Bharati Pawar’s victory.” Bhagare, a schoolteacher, is the NCP (SCP) nominee. Party insiders say their chief Sharad Pawar picked him for his clean image and popularity. A BJP politician, who did not want to be named, said farmers snub them when they visit villages for campaigning. “To placate them, we are highlighting the multiple schemes run by the Centre, including the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi that provides Rs 6,000 annually to marginal farmers.” In April, residents of Malwadi put up a board requesting the current MP not to visit their village. “Before the ban came into effect, we were getting Rs 2,500-Rs 3,000 per quintal. Now, prices have dropped while fertilisers and petrol have become dearer,” said Ganesh Ahire of Nandgaon taluk. While accepting that Bharati Pawar faces the ire of onion growers, a state Cabinet minister said: “The unseasonal rain severely hit the crop in Dindori. Had the Centre not banned exports, there would’ve been huge shortages in the country. That would’ve complicated matters for NDA, especially in urban areas.” What has further queered the pitch for BJP is CPI(M) nominee Je eva Pandu Gavit’s withdrawal from the race. CPI(M) had fielded Gavit in 2019, too and he had got more than one lakh votes. Anticipating that Gavit might repeat his performance and take away anti-BJP votes, Sharad Pawar convinced the CPI(M) brass to pull him from the race. Bharati Pawar, however, claims the opposition is misleading farmers. “When Sharad Pawar was the Union agriculture minister under UPA, prices of onion had dropped drastically several times. But since this is election season, the opposition is raking up the issue,” she said. BJP had poached Bharati Pawar from NCP before the 2019 elections, giving her the ticket instead of the then MP Harischandra Chavan. Bhagare, a political greenhorn, faced the setback of four party MLAs switching to deputy CM Ajit Pawar’s NCP camp. But he hopes farmers’ ire will see anti-BJP voters rally around him. “Given the anger among onion growers, my opponent’s defeat is certain. Though our MLAs have deserted us, we are counting on Sharad Pawar’s popularity among the farmers,” Bhagare said at a campaign rally.",Times of India,India

Basirhat’s location explains why this place witnessed large-scale migration since Partition with people engaged in a bitter struggle for survival.

CPI won the seat through the 1950s, having made major dents in the region during the Food Movement at that time. Subsequently, Congress tasted victory intermittently before CPI regained the constituency and held it for nearly three decades. But not anymore. The Lok Sabha seat is now a solid Trinamool stronghold that has party MLAs in all the seven assembly segments — Baduria, Haroa, Minakhan, Sandeshkhali , Basirhat Dakshin, Basirhat Uttar and Hingalganj. Nirapada Sardar was the last Left MLA from the area in 2011.

The BJP in the changed scenario has presence in Basirhat Dakshin, Sandeshkhali and Hingalganj. Basirhat Lok Sabha figures over a 10-year period (2009 to 2019) reflect the changing political loyalties. The 40.4% Left vote share in 2009 declined drastically to 4.8% in 2019 while Trinamool and BJP improved their shares mostly at the expense of the Left slide. The Trinamool vote share went up from 46.2% in 2009 to 54.9% in 2019 while BJP improved from 6.6% in 2009 to 30.3% in 2019. Basirhat was considered one of Trinamool’s bastions in south Bengal, till the recent groundswell in Sandeshkhali that hit national headlines. Sections of women came out of their homes chasing local Trinamool leaders in the area and openly complained against party strongman Sheikh Shahjahan for grabbing their farmlands and sexually abusing them. The complaints of women from an assembly segment reached Calcutta HC, making citizens sit up and take notice. A few days later, video clips of a BJP organiser that went viral on social media picked holes in the “sexual torture” narrative, though not the land-grab accusations. Subsequently, a woman BJP officebearer from North 24 Parganas crossed over to Trinamool and claimed that the Sandeshkhali affair was a “conspiracy,” by Bengal BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari. With accusations flying from both sides, it remains to be seen which version Sandeshkhali voters believe when polling takes place for the Basirhat seat on June 1. BJP, in a bid to set sail on the groundswell, nominated one of the agitators Rekha Patra, a homemaker, as the Basirhat candidate. PM Modi followed it up by talking to Patra over the phone, asking her about her election preparations. Trinamool, on the other hand, relies on an old hand, Haji Nurul Islam, a twotime Haroa MLA, with an eye on the Muslim voters who constitute around 54% of the population in the Lok Sabha constituency. “Some BJP and CPM leaders had deliberately tried to instigate innocent people in Sandeshkhali to spread violence. But we will build a new Sandeshkhali, with a renewed focus on development. We believe all the common people of Basirhat are with us,” Nurul said. According to local sources, Shahjahan and his gang took control of 40,000 bighas in the Sandeshkhali region, most of which were farmland taken over on lease and forcibly converted into bheris by flooding with saline water. “These bheri lands, which are leased out for Rs 10,000-15,000 per bigha, make the place a multi-crore lucrative business hub and a major supplier to the Kolkata market. By earning huge sums from the money-spinning ponds, Shahjahan and his associates built a formidable network in the Sandeshkhali area. They also offered money to hundreds of local unemployed youths for expanding their empire and widening their market,” a local farmer said. BJP candidate Patra, despite stiff opposition from Trinamool, is focused on Sandeshkhali. “I will fight the oppression and violence against women in the area till the end. The people of Basirhat are with me, supporting me because I am like their daughter, a girl from their family,” Patra said. CPM candidate Nirapada Sardar is also banking on the Sandeshkhali groundswell to get back the section of Left and Congress supporters in Basirhat who had voted for either BJP or Trinamool in the last few elections. “Trinamool didn’t allow elections in Sandeshkhali after the party came to office in 2011. People in Sandeshkhali and beyond in Basirhat, want peace. They want their farmlands back,” Sardar said. Basirhat, no doubt, is a prestige fight for Trinamool this time to “bust” the BJP “conspiracy” in Sandeshkhali. Trinamool national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee announced the other day that the party would win from Basirhat by a record margin of 4 lakh votes, surpassing the 3.5 lakh winning margin of Trinamool candidate and Bengali film actor Nusrat Jahan in 2019. BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari, on the other hand, has made Sandeshkhali the centre of the party’s campaign. The saffron party is determined to gain a lead in the Sandeshkhali segment to claim a moral victory, even if it trails in some other assembly segments of the Basirhat constituency.",Times of India,India

A political campaign spearheaded by Nadia Nadi Sansad , a coalition of 14 diverse organisations, has been launched, pressing parties to take a decisive action. Nadia district, for instance, was once blessed with 33 tidal rivers but now has only 10 that are struggling for survival. The rest have just disappeared. Tired of empty promises, Nadi Sansad members have taken matters into their own hands. They engage with candidates from all political parties to find out their plans and commitment to revive Ichhamati. A fixed ritual accompanies these encounters now — the offering of a garland followed by a barrage of questions from villagers demanding accountability on issues like Ichhamati’s restoration and the cleanup of Mathabhanga and Churni. Jyotirmoy Saraswati, a veteran Ichhamati crusader, laments the lack of understanding among many candidates regarding the river’s dire situation and its devas tating impact on people. “Ichhamati had a wide variety of fish stock, known for their unmatched tastes. Now people in Duttapulia, one of the major trade centres on its bank, survive on fish from Andhra Pradesh,” said Nadia Nadi Sansad secretary Sabarna Saraswati, who led a 140km walk along the banks of the Ichhamati to save the dying river. Sabarna and local villagers cleaned up more than 12km of the river. “Apart from plastic menace, there is overgrowth of phytoplankton, microalgae, and macroalgae, due to increasing flow of nitrogen and phosphorus in the water systems following intensive agricultural and industrial activities. This ultimately results in low oxygen or ‘hypoxic’ areas that jeopardise the health of the river, its aquatic life, and surrounding ecosystem,” he said. Local fishermen have pointed to concerns over the deteriorating water quality which is increasingly becoming inhospitable to aquatic life particularly immature fish and insects as their lifecycle is dwindled because of water hypoxia. Ichhamati is a witness of the desperation of people living around its flood plain. “Farmers grow crops on 30,000 acres of floodplain of Ichhamati spreading across these four parliamentary constituencies. As many as 40,000 fishers are dependent on the river,” said Jyotirmoy. Arjun Mandal, once a fisherman, has been compelled to do transition farming as fish ing in Ichhamati river became untenable. Reflecting on the change, he said: “We never imagined we wouldn’t be able to fish in the Ichhamati anymore. The drying Ichhamati bed has made even farming an increasingly difficult job to sustain my family.” Abdul Khaleq Malita from Srirampur, Nadia, used to rely on the Ichhamati for irrigating his land for jute cultivation. Now, he has switched to crops like parwal, banana, and rajanigandha that require less water. Fisherman Sunil Kumar Haldar, who became a farmer and now a contractor, lamented his desperate need to change professions due to the river’s decline: “People are now migrating to survive. Ichhamati’s decline has triggered alarming levels of migration and an uptick in traffic along its banks.” Amit Kumar Biswas, a schoolteacher and river activist from Bongaon, highlighted the ripple effects. “The drying of Ichhamati has impacted other water bodies like tanks and ponds, exacerbating water crises in summer. The numerous unlicensed brick kilns lining the riverbanks are causing extensive pollution.” Downstream, beyond Berigopalpur ghat in Basirhat, the river does not resemble its dying upstream. “But it is completely tidal saline water from the sea,” said Bishnupada Mridhha, who works with farmers and fishermen at Hingalganj in Basirhat parliamentary constituency. With the flow of the sweetwater having stopped completely, the lower course of Ichhamati, also known as Kalindi, in Basirhat, resulted in incursion of saline water into the groundwater table at an alarming rate. In a wide area of Panchapalli, no tubewell below 600 metres gives us sweet water. It is only saline water, unusable for drinking or irrigation,” he added. Illegal transverse check dams (badhals) have mushroomed along the 280km stretch of the Ichhamati, exacerbating its plight. These dams, constructed with substandard materials and nylon nets, are intended for fish trapping. Members of the fishing community admitted ignorance regarding the improper disposal of unusable nets into the river. “There was an attempt to dredge from Tentulia to Kalanchi for 23.4km to achieve a navigable depth of 1.5 metres all along the river. A budget of Rs 3.77 crore was sanctioned. But only a little could be achieved. The state govt decided to prepare a master plan for the restoration of the river,” said an officer in the state water resources investigation and development department.",Times of India,India

Mala Roy, who won in 2019 is defending the seat this time. What tilts the scales further in TMC’s favour is the significant 28% Muslim voters in the constituency who are expected to stay loyal to the party. “With due respect to my opposition candidates, I’m 200% confident of winning,” said Roy. “Not just because of our solid presence and base in this constituency but also because of my own track record here. My work speaks for itself. After Sougata Roy, I have asked the most questions in Parlia ment among Bengal MPs. Opposition parties are trying to malign us. They are even using multiple agencies to harass our functionaries. But the more they do so, the worse they will fare in this elections,” said Roy, who is also a local councillor and chairperson of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation.

The latter, grandnephew of Subhas Chandra Bose, is no longer in the party. Roy has a star-studded support team in the constituency. CM Banerjee is herself the Bhowanipore MLA. Urban development minister and Kolkata mayor Firhad Hakim represents Kolkata Port. Javed Ahmed Khan from Kasba is the disaster management minister and Babul Supriyo from Ballygunge is the head of non-conventional and renewable energy sources ministry. Then there is Debasis Kumar from Rasbehari who is the KMC’s mayoral council member (parks and square). Ratna Chatterjee from Behala Purba, the estranged wife of former mayor Sovan Chatterjee, is another influential functionary. With such heavyweight presence alongside many minority voters in the 18.5 lakh-strong electorate, political observers and analysts believe it is a nocontest in three assembly segments: Kolkata Port, Ballygunge and Kasba. And that, they believe, is enough to win the Kolkata South seat yet again. BJP has fielded Debasree Chaudhuri, the outgoing Lok Sabha member from Raiganj Parliamentary constituency in North Dinajpur district, against Roy. While many termed Chaudhuri’s ejection from her stronghold Raiganj to the comparatively lesser-known turf of Kolkata South as more of an exile, the former Union junior minister for woman and child development views it as an opportunity to prove her worth in Trinamool’s strongest seat. “It’s a TMC stronghold alright but one that is built on lies and corruption and my job is to breach the fortress. That is the reason why the party brass has chosen me to contest from this seat. Among the five ministers in this constituency, one is in jail, and some are on bail. It tells you a lot about the party,” said Chaudhuri. Though BJP has never won the seat, the first MP to be elected in 1952 from the constituency — then known as Calcutta South-East — was Syama Prasad Mookerjee, founder of BJP’s predecessor Bharatiya Jana Sangh. Also in the fray is CPM’s Saira Shah Halim, the daughter-in-law of Bengal’s longest-serving speaker Hashim Abdul Halim and niece of actor Naseeruddin Shah and daughter of former deputy chief of Army staff, Lt Gen Zameer Uddin Shah. A relative newcomer to politics, Saira has been praised for her role in rejuvenating the CPM’s prospects in the closely contested Ballygunge assembly bypoll in 2022. She surprised many by finishing second ahead of BJP’s Keya Ghosh. Although Saira lost to Trinamool’s Babul Supriyo by 20,000 votes, her performance resulted in a significant 24% increase in her party’s vote share. However, Kolkata South is a different ballgame. The Left has won the seat only three times in the past: 1967, 1980 and 1989. But Saira says she is not daunted by the task at hand. “BJP is tinkering with the Constitution and Trinamool is full of corruption. People here are fed up with them and need an honest representative. People have seen how red volunteers have worked during Covid and showered their faith upon me in the 2022 bypoll. This cosmopolitan constituency needs a progressive and educative face and there is none better than me,” said the writer, activist and educator who was a business development and communications trainer with the West Bengal Electronics Industry Development Corporation Ltd before she took the political plunge.",Times of India,India

On Sandeshkhali, where allegations of sexual abuse against TMC leaders have surfaced, Shah said it is a matter of shame that ""Mamata Banerjee, despite being a woman chief minister, tried to protect the culprits."" ""For years, heinous crimes were carried out against women on the basis of religion. Mamata was not ready to arrest the criminals as the name of the culprit was Shajahan Sheikh and for her vote bank politics. Even after the high court's order, the investigation was not conducted, and the court handed over the probe to the CBI,"" the senior BJP leader said. His remarks come in the backdrop of multiple purported videos of Sandeshkhali women in the public domain, which claim that a local saffron party leader made those women sign blank papers which were later filled up as complaints of sexual assault. Shah, however, didn't directly refer to those videos. Shah said political violence has ""killed democracy in Bengal."" ""Panchayat elections were held here, in which more than 200 people were killed. But I want to tell you that this time you should not be afraid because in the five phases of elections, TMC goons could not harm anyone. And we will teach these goons a lesson this time,"" he said. Referring to the raid on BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari's residence on Tuesday night, Shah said, ""The more the TMC tortures Suvendu Adhikari, the more BJP will give him prominence."" Shah said the TMC has turned its slogan of ""Maa Mati Manush"" into ""Mullah, Madrasa, and Mafia"" due to appeasement politics. Referring to the politics of appeasement by the TMC, Shah said invitations for the Ram temple consecration ceremony were sent to both Mamata and her nephew (Abhishek Banerjee), but they chose not to attend it, ""as they are afraid that infiltrators, who are TMC's vote bank, might get offended."" Hitting out at the TMC on the issue of graft, Shah said only the BJP can end the TMC's ""rule of corruption"" in Bengal. ""A sum of Rs 51 crore was recovered from the minister, who was responsible for giving jobs to the poor. This money doesn't belong to the minister, it belongs to the people of West Bengal,"" Shah said, referring to Partha Chatterjee, who was arrested in connection with the school jobs scam. Dubbing Banerjee as ""Hirak Rani"" in an apparent reference to the film ""Hirak Rajar Deshe"" by Oscar-awarded filmmaker Satyajit Ray, Shah said, ""Satyajit Ray was a great artist and filmmaker. He made a movie - Hirak Rajar Deshe."" ""Had he been alive today, he would have made a movie named 'Hirak Rani', instead of 'Hirak Rajar Deshe'. Mamata Banerjee is the Hirak Rani,"" he said. Criticising the TMC's resistance to central projects in Bengal, Shah said the funds sent by the Centre are siphoned off by the TMC. ""On the other hand, the Modi government in the last 10 years has provided a whopping Rs 9.25 lakh crore. But this money did not benefit the common people as it was siphoned off by TMC goons,"" he said.",Times of India,India

Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury will not take the decision. The decision will be taken by me and the high command, and those who do not agree will go out,"" Kharge said. The Congress chief also asserted that Chowdhury is no one to decide whether Banerjee would be part of the INDIA bloc in the event of the anti-BJP alliance coming to power. However, despite the strong remarks of Kharge, Adhir did not budge over his stand against Mamata. ""I cannot speak in favour of someone who wants to finish me and our party in Bengal politically. This is a battle for every Congress worker. I have spoken on their behalf. I do not want the state Congress to be used for her (Banerjee's) personal agenda,"" Adhir said reacting to Kharge's outburst. Meanwhile, taking serious note of ""anti-party activities"" in the state, Congress has sought a report over the acts of indiscipline. KC Venugopal, general secretary (organisation) issued a stern statement on Monday. ""We are taking a very serious note of such grave anti party activities. The Indian National Congress shall not tolerate such public display of defiance and indiscipline. The general secretary in charge of West Bengal is directed to immediately submit a factual report of these acts of gross indiscipline,"" a statement by Venugopal read. According to sources in the Congress, Chowdhury, who is in his hometown of Baharampur in Murshidabad district, expressed displeasure over the incident and asked the party workers to get a police complaint lodged. In its complaint to the state police, West Bengal Congress said some group of unidentified miscreants yesterday defaced ""the images of Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge with black ink in multiple banners across state including the one displayed in front of the gate of Pradesh Congress Headquarters, Bidhan Bhavan"". However, two days after his strong remarks, Kharge, in a surprising turn on Monday, once again heaped praised on Adhir and called him a "" ladaku sipahi "" (combative soldier) of the grand old party. The Congress chief also blamed some Trinamool leaders of trying to drive a wedge between the two parties. ""I do not want to speak about an individual. He (Chowdhury) is a combative soldier of the Congress party and is our leader in West Bengal,"" Kharge said and added that some Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders are now trying to rake up the issue of the Congress's alliance with the Left but it will not work. ""They are trying to present it differently. But it will not happen like this as the Congress party is strong and understands each other. What has happened in West Bengal is that the Congress high command has taken a decision to have a coalition with the Left and we are moving forward with that,"" Kharge said. For the Congress, the happenings in Bengal brings with it a strange sense of deja vu that perhaps makes the party uncomfortable. In 1998, Mamata Banerjee had quit the Congress to form her own party to protest the grand old party's inaction in the face of Left ""atrocities"" on party cadres in Bengal. Nearly, 26 years later, Adhir is singing the same tune. The only difference is that the government is of Mamata Banerjee and the Left is now with the Congress. Will the grand old party change its stand vis-à-vis Mamata. Well, it would most likely depend on the results of Lok Sabha elections on June 4. Till then, it is perhaps happy to use its ""Ladaku Sipahi"" to keep the pressure going on Mamata.",Times of India,India

The EC announced that Tamil Nadu registered a voter turnout of 69.46%, almost 3.5 percentage points lower than in the 2019 general elections. The Election Commission had earlier announced a 72% turnout, but it revised the figure later. In the previous 2019 elections, the DMK-led alliance triumphed in 38 out of 39 seats in Tamil Nadu. Alliances The DMK contested on 22 seats and spearheads an eight-party alliance comprising the Congress (9), CPI(M) (2), CPI (2), Indian Muslim League (1), Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (2), Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (1), and Kongunadu Makkal Desia Katchi (KMDK), whose candidate will run on the DMK symbol. On the other side, the AIADMK (34 seats) lead an alliance with four parties, including the Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (5 seats). Additionally, candidates from Puthiya Tamilagam and Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) contested on the AIADMK symbol. The BJP, contesting on 23 seats, formed an alliance with nine other parties, such as the Pattali Makkal Katchi (10 seats), Tamil Maanila Congress (Moopanar) (3), and splinter groups of the AIADMK, including former chief minister O. Pannerselvam (1) standing as an independent, and Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (2) led by TTV Dhinakaran. Indhiya Jananayaga Katchi, Puthiya Needhi Katchi, and Tamizhaga Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam will each contest on the BJP symbol. With the AIADMK and BJP candidates vying to challenge the DMK, some closely contested battles are expected within these alliances. Notably, a total of 21 incumbents from the INDIA bloc have been renominated across Tamil Nadu, including prominent figures like Kanimozhi Karunanidhi, Su. Venkatesan, S Jothimani, TR Baalu, and Thamizhachi Thangapandian. Direct contests The election witnessed direct face-offs among DMK, AIADMK, and BJP candidates in ten constituencies, such as Coimbatore, Chennai North, Chennai South, Vellore, and others. Notably, in Chennai South, the contest involve the incumbent MP Thamizhachi Thangapandian (DMK), J. Jayavardhan (AIADMK), and Tamilisai Soundararajan (BJP). Key issues in the election have revolved around the DMK-Congress alliance's stance on federalism, portraying the BJP as a threat to minority and Dalit communities, and criticising the alleged bias against Tamil students in exams like NEET. Opposition parties have also highlighted issues such as corruption allegations against Stalin's family, the drug trade, and high electricity prices in the state. BJP-NDA prospects The BJP is hoping to make major headway in a state that has never given it more than four seats (in the 1999 Lok Sabha elections). It failed to open its account in 2019 while its partner, the AIADMK, managed to win the seat of Theni by a narrow vote margin of 6.2%. High-octane poll campaigning in Tamil Nadu this time around saw the BJP go all out and rake up hot-button issues like Katchatheevu to lure voters away from the Congress as well as regional parties like the AIADMK (its past ally) or M K Stalin's DMK (which has allied with the Congress in the 2024 elections). Revealing the importance of the state in the BJP's poll strategy, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has visited Tamil Nadu at least 8 times in the past four months and has held several rallies and roadshows to drum up support for the party as well as its star candidate K Annamalai. Seats of interest for the BJP The BJP contested on 23 seats, while it's much smaller allies fought on the remaining 16 seats. BJP state unit chief Annamalaiwas pitted from Coimbatore, a seat that the party lost by a vote margin of 14.6% in the 2019 polls to P. R. Natarajan of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) CPM. Lok Sabha seats of Chidambaram, Vellore and Dharmapuri, Theni and Tiruppur saw a neck to neck fight where victory margin was less than 10% in the last Lok Sabha polls.",Times of India,India

If the NDA retains power, Narendra Modi will continue as PM. The Union government's delay in financial allocations, including for flood relief, impacts Tamil Nadu's fiscal situation.","On May 7, the Tamil Nadu govt headed by chief minister M K Stalin completed three years in office. Politically, however, it would be stepping into the fourth year only after June 4 when the general election results show who would form the govt at Centre. Opinion polls have differed only on numbers while giving NDA a virtually unassailable lead. If the miracle INDIA dream fails to materialise, Narendra Modi will be back as Prime Minister.

In the second, it wakes up to fiscal realities, and in the third, it struggles to fulfil the election promises the party had made. This is also the time when the govt is likely to introduce some unpopular measures to shore up revenues that its populism had started draining (Stalin’s first finance minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan was prudent enough to prescribe – and administer – some “bitter pills” by increasing power tariff, property tax, motor vehicle tax and liquor price). Into the fourth year, party workers, realising that time is running out, demand their pound of flesh before the next election. This is also the time when the govt is more likely to face allegations as the opposition ups its game. In the fifth year, the govt can ill afford to take harsh fiscal measures. The result: Frugal means and frightful expectations. The Stalin govt is getting into this phase. TOI on May 10 analysed how Tamil Nadu has been smarting under a fund crunch as the Union govt has been holding back financial allocations including those for flood relief and the central share for the second phase of Chennai Metro Rail. Stalin used this victim card quite efficiently during the general election campaign.

In a way, BJP, while denying any step-motherly treatment to states where opposition parties run govts, has been not-so-subtly driving home the message that being friendly with Centre pays for state. Powering BJP’s campaign cavalcade in Uttar Pradesh was its ‘double engine’ theory. The message: With BJP at Centre, having a BJP govt in your state ensures rapid growth. It’s another matter that UP’s health, human development and economic indices are much inferior to TN’s. UP, with a GSDP of close to 24 lakh crore has a growth rate of 5. 8%, while TN with a GSDP of more than 28 lakh crore grows at 14. 6%. Here are some other random comparisons: Infant mortality rate (deaths per 1,000 live births) in UP is 38 (the national average is 28. 7); in TN it is 8. 2. Maternal mortality rate (per one lakh live births):UP — 130, TN — 90. Literacy rate: UP — 68%, TN — 80%). Politics is a game of perceptions, but these facts prove that while it is desirable for a state to have a good rapport with the Union govt, Centre cannot afford to stymie the organic growth of a state. If it does, it would be detrimental not just for the state, but for the nation as a whole (TN contributes close to 9% of India’s GDP). Nevertheless, the BJP is bound to propound the double-engine theory in all opposition states as well when they have assembly elections. It remains to be seen what AIADMK and BJP learn from their separation. Whether they reunite or remain at loggerheads, Stalin has his job cut out to prove that Tamil Nadu has not just the resolve, but also the means, to continue its march towards the trillion-dollar dream irrespective of who presides over the Union govt. And let’s not forget that the 2026 match will have not just the usual players, but a debutant who says, “I’m waiting”. — arun. ram@timesgroup. com",Times of India,India

The district has vibrant agriculture with paddy, plantain, rubber and cashew crops. The constituency is unique in TN as the majority are Christians, including Nadars of Catholic and Protestant denominations. The fisherfolk are mostly Catholic or Muslim. Hindus are predominantly Nadars, Nairs, Pillais and Dalits and a small tribal community. Thanks to the Mandaikadu communal riots in 1982, the district stayed polarised. With Kanyakumari sharing the weather pattern of Kerala, summer means festival time for temples. Located a few km from the shore, the temples are decked up with BJP flags. “Ponnar enjoys significant loyalty among Hindu voters here. He had also ensured important projects like Marthandam flyover and fourlane projects for the district,” says S Shanmugham from Parvathipuram, a Hindu-dom inant village near the coast. But some ambitious projects initiated by Ponnar had earned the ire of fisherfolk. “We had to protest every day to stop the Enayam trans-shipment harbour proposed by him. We have stomachs to feed, we can’t go through that nightmare again,” says M Anto, a fisherman at Inayamputhenthurai. They fear that the project would displace them. With these factors, Congress candidate Vijay Vasanth should have a fair chance, but there is a catch. ADMK has fielded a candidate from fisher community, Pasilian Nazareth. “He won’t win but he’ll divide the fisher community votes,” says a Muslim shop owner at Thengapattinam. Maria Jennifer, a Naam Tamilar Katchi (NTK) candidate who is campaigning in the Colachel area, hails from fisher community as well. Jennifer and her followers are raking up the issue of Kanyakumari’s blue metal being mined for the Vizhinjam harbour project in Kerala, a simmering issue in the district. With two other candidates fishing for votes along the coast, the battle gets tougher for Vijay and makes it easier for Ponnar. Nevertheless, Congress has used a trump card to woo the coastal voters. After six decades, it has given an assembly seat to a candidate from the fisher community. Tharahai Cuthbert has been given the ticket to contest the Vilavancode assembly by-election, also scheduled for April 19. The constituency fell vacant after Vijayadharini switched loyalties to BJP. Vilavancode is a Congress fort. “Resident or outsider, it does not matter. Anyone fielded by Congress will win here,” says N Shashi, a farmer from the constituency. Cuthbert is campaigning hard in the remote hilly assembly seat. “I know I have just two years and I am not making unrealistic promises. My focus is decent roads and bus connectivity,” she told TOI. A long-time resident of Marthandam and a Youth Congress member, Cuthbert does not feel like an outsider at Vilavancode. The enthusiasm among fisherfolk is rooted in this arithmetic. Cuthbert also hails from the family of Lourdammal Simon, who was fisheries minister in K Kamaraj govt and is held in high esteem. For a long time, ADMK had enjoyed popularity among fisherfolk here but the DMK functionaries among them are working hard to send the message that “we are supporting Vijay because of Tharahai”. Fishermen T Charlie and Mohan Raj from Keelamanakudi are convinced they should support Congress. “It was fine as long as MGR and Amma were there. How can we trust that EPS won’t side with BJP after winning?” they ask. Vijay Vasanth is confident. “An anti-Modi wave is very tangible. Kanyakumari goes by national politics and voters here are upset with BJP,” he said. His father Vasanthakumar had big plans for the constituency, like an airport, tourism development and air ambulance for fishermen. “I will work to fulfill all these promises,” said Vijay.",Times of India,India

Initially, DMK felt it would sail through easily. But then there were signs that Annamalai's popularity was not just an urban phenomenon. There were rural youth too who backed him. A few influential industrialists also backed BJP. DMK had to plan a strategy to arrest the momentum. TRB Raaja, state industries minister who is the in charge in Coimbatore, met industrialists individually. He got them to meet CM M K Stalin too. Sensing that a number of youth were attracted to BJP, DMK announced plan for a world class cricket stadium in Coimbatore in the midst of a heated campaign. Congress MP Rahul Gandhi's visit to Coimbatore was chalked out to help DMK. NDA also seems to have an edge in Dharmapuri, where BJP ally PMK has fielded Sowmiya Anbumani, wife of Anbumani Ramadoss. A popular candidate from the party which has considerable backing from the largest caste bloc in the constituency, Vanniyars, along with an aggressive BJP make the fight tough in Dharmapuri. Sowmiya also managed to reach out to women voters, cutting across caste lines. The arithmetic is against DMK on this seat as 35% of the electorate here are Vanniyars and a consolidation of this vote bank would be a serious threat to the party, analysts say. DMK is banking on Dalits and minorities, who together roughly equal the Vanniyars. Another BJP ally, AMMK's T T V Dhinakaran who was expelled from ADMK, has mounted a serious challenge to the DMK alliance in Theni in the south. TTV's popularity, his Mukkulathor caste's numerical strength and the candidates' money power make the fight a challenging one in Theni. DMK's Thanga Tamilselvan is also a familiar face, since he has been a three-time MLA in Andipatti, which falls in Theni Lok Sabha seat. But his popularity comes only next to TTV. In Tirunelveli, another southern seat, BJP's Nainar Nagendran is giving sleepless nights to the DMK front. Nainar had begun his groundwork here even before DMK ally Congress could announce its candidate. Congress candidate Robert Bruce also faced opposition from his own party as he was from the neighbouring Kanyakumari district. Nainar's momentum, however, was arrested after his name was linked to a seizure of Rs 4 cr in cash in Chennai. In Nilgiris, BJP candidate L Murugan has earned the goodwill of a lot of people and has won over the support of Dalits in several villages. Badagas, an influential tribal bloc in Nilgiris, are also touted to back Murugan, a Union minister. But DMK's A Raja has the backing of Sri Lankan Tamil repatriates, who are in sizeable numbers in Gudalur. Also, DMK alliance has a stronger presence in three out of six assembly segments in Nilgiris, which makes the fight bitter. Yet another star constituency is Chennai South, where ex-governor Tamilisai Sounderarajan is in the fray, banking on urban, upper class votes. But DMK's Tamilachi Thangapandian appears to have an edge here.",Times of India,India

Panneerselvam, backed by TTV Dhinakaran, highlights Jayalalithaa's legacy. The election carries significance for India's future development under Modi's leadership.","Jai Shri Ram’ and ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ slogans rend the air as JP Nadda’s cavalcade rolls down a road in Paramakudi in south Tamil Nadu. The BJP president sports a scarf with the jackfruit symbol of former chief minister O Panneerselvam who is contesting from Ramanathapuram Lok Sabha constituency as an Independent candidate of the NDA alliance after his expulsion from ADMK. “Vendum Modi, meendum Modi (We want Modi, once again Modi),” the crowd chants as Nadda’s roadshow moves on in the constituency that goes to polls this Friday. For Panneerselvam, an MLA from Bodinayakanur, the contest is a matter of prestige as he continues his legal battle with ADMK general secretary Edappadi K Palaniswami. But as of now, he has only Modi to thank. “Modi has been overseeing diverse states, languages, and cultures. No caste or religious conflict has occurred during his tenure,” Panneerselvam tells TOI. “Palaniswami has bought off ADMK leaders, but the cadres are with me.” Panneerselvam had stepped in for former ADMK chief Jayalalithaa twice, when she was disqualified or had to go to prison in corruption cases. He had another brief stint as CM soon after she died. Having been restrained by courts from using the ADMK flag, Panneerselvam displays large portraits of Jayalalithaa on his campaign vehicle. Jayalalithaa confidante VK Sasikala’s nephew TTV Dhinakaran has extended the support of his party Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) to Panneerselvam. But Nadda knows Panneerselvam cannot win this battle on his past glory. “This is not just an election of Panneerselvam ji,” he tells a rally. “It’s also to make India a developed country in 2047.” OPS also faces the menace of dummy candidates: There are at least four other candidates by the name Panneerselvam. That the NDA candidate doesn’t have a popular symbol has added to his headache. Spread across three districts — Pudukkottai, Virudhunagar and Ramanathapuram, the seat comprises six assembly segments (Aranthangi, Tiruchuli, Paramakudi (reserved), Tiruvadanai, Ramanathapuram and Mudukulathur) which are all represented by either DMK or Congress. Mukkulathors (30%), Dalits (25%) and Muslims (17%), besides Thevars, remain the influential groups here. Panneerselvam, a Mukkulathor, is relying on Dalits who have cosied up to BJP after Modi gave them the dignified name of Devendrakula Vellalars in 2021. But he is pitted against incumbent Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) MP K Navas Kani— an ally of DMK and part of INDIA bloc, who enjoys the support of Muslims in Ramanathapuram, Thiruvadanai, and Aranthangi, as well as the sizeable Christians and fisherfolk. Eyeing the fishing community vote, BJP has tried to rekindle interest in Katchatheevu, the islet of contention between fishing communities of Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka. For Ramanathapuram fisherfolk, the dispute with Lanka over fishing rights is a pain point. The Lankan navy has repeatedly fired at and captured Tamil Nadu fishermen. More than 350 boats of Indian fishermen remain in Lankan custody. “A boat costs Rs 25 lakh to Rs 1 crore. At least 50 families rely on a boat for livelihood. The families are now migrating to other states,” said All Mechanized Boats Association president P Sesuraja. Fishermen of Ramanathapuram largely belong to the Christian community. DMK minister Thangam Thennarasu dismissed Katchatheevu as a non-issue. “People know it is all stagemanaged,” he said. Along with DMK minister R S Raja Kannappan, Thennarasu has been engaging with the Mukkulathor and Yadava communities to gain support for Kani. In Ramanathapuram, Palaniswami too has criticised BJP for using Katchatheevu for political gains, and highlighted Jayalalithaa’s efforts at retrieving the islet. The party’s candidate P Jeyaperumal, meanwhile, is banking on the ‘two leaves symbol’ and perceived anti-incumbency against the state and Union govts. But ADMK is facing heat from the Mukkulathor community for reducing the MBC quota to extend the Vanniyar quota. The DMK camp continues to call ADMK “stooges of BJP”.",Times of India,India

BJP's Annamalai faces competition from DMK and ADMK. DMK's alliance adds to the challenge in this high-stakes political arena.","Coimbatore is one of the few constituencies in Tamil Nadu where national and state politics intersect. This industrial hub in the foothills of the Western Ghats has traditionally been an ADMK stronghold. But thanks to a large number of migrants from north India, national parties like BJP , Congress and Left also have a presence here. BJP considers Coimbatore its favourite turf, counting heavily on the sizeable north Indian population, who it hopes are supporters of PM Narendra Modi. Add to that the decades-old communal polarisation, a fissure that appeared after the 1998 serial blasts targeting BJP’s LK Advani. All these factors may have led BJP to field its state president, 39-year-old former IPS officer K Annamalai, from this constituency. But while Annamalai brims with confidence, it won’t be an easy task for him to take on the two Dravidian majors — DMK and ADMK — both of whom have their loyal followers. DMK’s formidable nine party alliance, the party’s muscle and money power give it an obvious advantage. ADMK, for its part, has a robust grassroots presence here and a powerful regional satrap – former minister S P Velumani. But BJP, despite its popularity, lacks a grassroots poll management apparatus. Annamalai, though, is not deterred. “Coimbatore voters have decided their MP candidate. BJP will get 60% of the votes polled,” he says. Annamalai has been promising to take Coimbatore to the next level of industrial and infrastructural growth once Modi becomes PM for the third time and he becomes an MP. There are several takers for that promise. “Only if there is a ruling party MP, we will get more projects,” says a member of an industrial association. It’s not new for BJP to mount a serious challenge to Dravidian parties in Coimbatore. BJP’s C P Radhakrishnan had won Coimbatore in 1998 as an ADMK ally, and then again in 1999 as a DMK ally. But, since then, victory has been elusive for BJP in parliamentary polls. Radhakrishnan, however, managed to push DMK to third position and emerged runner-up with 3.9 lakh votes in 2014, when BJP floated its own front, taking on the Dravidian majors. But all along, it was ADMK which was the dominant force in Coimbatore as well as neighbouring districts of western TN, collectively called Kongu Nadu. “Because people know who serves them better,” says ADMK’s candidate Singai G Ramachandran, the IIM-educated IT wing secretary of the party. While both the BJP and ADMK candidates are IIMeducated, DMK’s Ganapathy Rajkumar is a doctorate. “BJP will be routed in Coimbatore,” says Rajkumar. The ruling party not only wants to disprove the theory that it is weak in Kongu heartland but also wants to arrest the rise of Annamalai. In more ways than one, the demography of Coimbatore is dichotomous. Alongside the large working-class population, there is the aspirational upwardly mobile urban resident here. Next to the culturally rooted rural population, there is a growing young and tech-savvy crowd. Though Coimbatore is a melting pot of cultures, the place also has people with deeply ingrained caste sentiments. The constituency is a mix of Gounders, Naidus, Malayalees, north Indians, Arunthathiyars and Muslims. Annamalai belongs to majority Gounder community. So does Rajkumar, while Ramachandran is a Naidu. Since 1952, DMK had field ed candidates in Coimbatore only thrice while ADMK just once – they chose to give the seat to their national allies, hoping Congress or the Left would cash in on the trade unions at the textile mills. The last time DMK won in Coimbatore was in 1996. Though its allies CPI and CPM won the seat in 2004 and 2019, DMK was always a little wary of Coimbatore. This time though, the Dravidian major has taken the plunge, confident after back-to-back victories in assembly, LS and local body polls since 2019. Urban Coimbatore has a sizeable north Indian population that backs Modi. Muslims also have a good presence. In rural areas the votes are usually split between DMK and ADMK, but this time saffron flags too can be seen flapping in several villages. The stakes are high for all the three parties. If DMK wants to prove its mettle in Kongu Nadu and ADMK wants to retain its bastion, BJP wants to repeat the feat it achieved 25 years ago by winning in Coimbatore. Annamalai has been raking up a host of issues targeting DMK — from corruption, dynastic politics, its alleged anti-Hindu approach, deteriorating law and order and increasing drug trafficking. A poor show by BJP here will also bring the spotlight on Annamalai’s remarks which forced erstwhile ally ADMK to walk out of the alliance.",Times of India,India

The Union government is responsible for fixing it. If it’s the same govt again, there is no relief for small tea farmers,” said state tourism minister K Ramachandran, from the Badaga indigenous community residing in the hills. There are 50,000 small tea farmers registered with the Tea Board in Coonoor. “The INDIA bloc, in its manifesto, has promised Rs 35 per kg,” he said. “On the tourism front, the state govt is focusing on increasing number of lodgings and restaurants in Nilgiris constituency. Car parking is a huge headache. The chief minister (M K Stalin) has promised hydraulic car parking,” said Ramachandran. Centering their campaign on anti-Narendra Modi slogans, Ramachandran is confident Raja will poll more than 70% votes, emphasising on the “fallacious concept of one nation, one election, one religion”. Raja and other DMK campaigners, meanwhile, are keeping off the controversial ‘Sanatan Dharma’ issue. Raja’s statement, soon after TN minister Udhayanidhi Stalin’s remarks, on the issue had triggered an uproar and dragged both into a bitter political and legal confrontation with BJP leaders. Campaigning in the Nilgiris, Raja in a traditional Badaga attire of white shirt and veshti, a ‘seelai’ (cotton shawl) draped around his neck, lists out achievements of DMK govt, comes down hard on BJP in the Bilkis Bano case, and accuses the Modi govt of “unleashing” central agencies on opponents. “His govt indulges in so much corruption, but he claims to be a Vishwa Guru (world leader),” says Raja. He barely touches on religion except when he says “everyone has a right to pray to their gods”, though he himself is a non-believer. Murugan, meanwhile, plays cricket in veshti in Manjoor in Kundah taluk and dances in traditional Badaga attire at a temple in Thummanatty village near Ooty. On spotting an ADMK flag on his campaign vehicle, he gets furious and directs workers to unscrew it immediately. During his campaign, he hails the Union govt schemes, alleges corruption in disbursal of funds in state govt schemes, promises a good price for green leaf tea, talks about Raja’s “arrogance”, says people want change and belittles DMK’s ‘social justice’ claims. “Thamaraikku (lotus) bekku (vote for lotus),” says Murugan, who knows a smattering of the Badaga language. Located at the junction of three states, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka, Nilgiris has a small Malayali and Kannadiga population. A reserved constituency, Nilgiris comprises six assembly constituencies, spread across four districts—Nilgiris, and Coimbatore, Tirupur and Erode in the plains. The voting population in the plains, including assembly segments Bhavanisagar (Erode), Mettupalayam (Coimbatore) and Avinashi (Tirupur), totals 8.5 lakh. People downhill, in the plains, have as much say as those in the hills, if not more, in deciding poll outcomes. Pollution of river Bhavani, poor remuneration for weavers and lack of basic amenities in tribal hamlets are the key issues in these segments. Tea estate workers, mostly Sri Lankan repatriates, work ing in Tamil Nadu Tea Plantation Corporation (Tantea) have largely been supportive of DMK. Tantea was created to rehabilitate them as far back as in 1968 under the then DMK regime. Congress too had a strong base in Nilgiris with former Union minister R Prabhu having won in the constituency five times, and the party itself notching poll victories seven times. R Raniammal, a small tea farmer, says, “I have been receiving Rs 1,000 every month now from Stalin govt. I will be faithful to DMK.” A long-time resident of Gudalur, K Bakyanathan, says, “The estate workers in Gudalur are traditional voters of Dravidian parties. With a strong alliance, DMK has an edge but the fight is difficult.” Udhagamandalam Congress MLA R Ganesh says the Congress-DMK alliance is strong in Nilgiris. “Raja’s prospects are bright.” But BJP state executive committee member Sabitha Bojan says, “Raja’s attitude towards Hindus has antagonised voters. People are ready to shift loyalties to Murugan. Moreover, Modiji is going to lead the country and Murugan will be part of the govt.” Supporting Sabita’s stand, a small tea farmer from Kotagiri taluk, K Shanmugam, says there is growing support for Modi and BJP among the present generation of small tea farmers. “Unbelievably, there is a growing Modi wave in every Badaga village,” says Shanmugam. The Badagas, Todas, Kotas, Irulas, Kurumbas, Paniyas and Kattunayakans constitute a sizeable slice of voters among the ethno-linguistic communities. While the Badagas, among the most influential of voters in the hills and categorised under Scheduled Tribe, were shifted to BC category post-Independence, they continue to fight for the reinstatement of their lost community tag. The Badagas, about 2.5 lakh voting population among them, live in hattis (villages) across the hill district. Total production of “madetea” in south India (mostly from the Nilgiris) for 2022-23 was 225.47 million kg.

Won seven times on Congress ticket, faces challenge from YSRCP. Prepares for 2024 polls, aims for one-lakh majority in general elections.","TIRUPATI: Former chief minister Nara Chandrababu Naidu, who usually doesn't campaign for himself in Kuppam right before any elections , has broken his own pattern by campaigning for himself in his home constituency in Chittoor district over the last two days. The TDP chief shifted to the tail-end Kuppam assembly constituency way back in 1989 after suffering defeat in his home constituency, Chandragiri, in the 1983 elections when he contested on a Congress party ticket. Earlier, Naidu won his maiden election as an MLA on a Congress party ticket from Chandragiri in the 1978 elections. Since 1989, Naidu has secured seven consecutive victories in Kuppam and has transformed this constituency into his formidable fortress. After becoming the Chief Minister of the state for the first time in 1996, Naidu stopped campaigning for himself just before the elections in Kuppam. Instead, he chose to tour this constituency about six months before every election. There have also been times when some of his family members substituted for Naidu and campaigned for him, giving the TDP chief the opportunity to cement the party's prospects in the rest of the state. However, this scenario completely changed after Naidu's majority plummeted drastically to about 30,000 votes in the 2019 elections, and after the YSRCP made massive inroads into Naidu's bastion in the municipal and local bodies' polls in Kuppam. With the ruling party also enforcing its ""Why not Kuppam"" strategy effectively in the last few years, the TDP chief, who realized he cannot risk taking chances in the 2024 polls , which pose a do-or-die situation not just for the party alone but for himself too, went into an aggressive campaign mode in Kuppam over the last two days. While addressing back-to-back roadshows, public meetings, and closed-door interactions with party workers in the last two days, Naidu recalled his connection with the people of Kuppam, his achievements as a seven-time MLA of the constituency, and appealed to the people to give him a one-lakh majority in the ensuing general elections in which he will be contesting from Kuppam for the eighth consecutive term.",Times of India,India

TDP, BJP, Jana Sena name 141 MLA, 13 MP. Key constituencies finalized. Former in-charge selected over Devineni Umamaheswara Rao. Various options considered for other seats.","VIJAYAWADA: The opposition has revealed its third list , disclosing the names of 13 MP and 11 MLA candidates . The TDP has named most of its candidates for both assembly and Lok Sabha. Out of the 145 assembly and 17 Lok Sabha seats being contested by the TDP in alliance with BJP and Jana Sena , candidates for 141 MLA and 13 MP seats have been announced so far. Putting an end to the ambiguity over some of the key seats like Penamaluru, Sarvapalli, Narasaraopet , and Palasa , the TDP high command reposed faith in the existing in-charges. After much drama in the Penamaluru constituency in Krishna district, the TDP has finally given the ticket to the current in-charge, Bode Prasad, dashing the hopes of former minister Devineni Umamaheswara Rao, who lost the Mylavaram ticket to his rival and incumbent MLA Vasantha Krishna Prasad, who switched sides from YSRC to TDP. TDP chief N. Chandrababu Naidu did not announce the candidate for the Sarvepalli constituency in Nellore district, which is represented by former minister Somireddy Chandramohan Reddy. There has been much speculation over a change of candidate in Sarvepalli given the poor track record of Chandramohan Reddy. However, the former minister managed to convince the high command and finally got the ticket. Similarly, in Narasaraopet, Chirala, and Palasa assembly segments, the TDP high command considered various options but finally reposed faith in the existing in-charges. While the Narasaraopet ticket was given to Dr. Chadalavada Aravaind Babu, Chirala has been given to M. M. Kondaiah Yadav, and Gouthu Sirisha retained Palasa. Interestingly, all three of them are from BC communities. The TDP is yet to announce its candidates in Etcherla, Cheepurupalli, Bhimili, Darsi, Rajampet, Alur, Guntakal, and Anantapur urban constituencies. However, there will be some tweaks to these constituencies as the TDP has announced a candidate for the Srikakulam assembly, which was not there in the initial proposal. Jana Sena is likely to get one seat from North Andhra districts as part of the last-minute adjustments, according to sources. Similarly, in Rayalaseema districts also, one or two changes are likely to be made as part of the seat-sharing arrangement with BJP, said sources. List of MLA candidates in the third list: Palasa: Gouthu Sirisha. Patapatnam: Mamidi Govind Rao. Srikakulam: Gondu Shankar. Srungavarapukota: Kolla Lalita Kumari.

Addressing impressive Prajagalam public meetings at Banaganapalle in Nandyal district and Kavali in Nellore district on Friday, the TDP chief underlined that Jagan ruined the state on all fronts in the last five years. ""Not a single section of the society was spared from Jagan's onslaught and vengeance filled politics in the last five years. He hasn't spared his own family members. While the YSRCP gained politically after the brutal murder of Jagan's own paternal uncle YS Vivekananda Reddy and came to power after the 2019 elections, he is now conspiring to target Viveka's daughter Dr Suneetha Reddy and send her to jail in order to protect Kadapa MP YS Avinash Reddy and his father YS Bhaskar Reddy"", Naidu alleged and dared the Chief minister to answer numerous questions posed to him by his own sister Dr Suneetha Reddy. Naidu also slammed the Chief minister for ridiculing about his age. ""I'm definitely aged but can you even match my energy levels in terms of reaching out to the people and in terms of trying to transform Andhra Pradesh into a number one state in the country on all fronts"", the TDP chief questioned. The people of Rayalaseema districts should realise that I too am a son of the soil born in this region only. ""While we tried to bring Godavari waters to the Rayalaseema region and allocated funds to the tune of Rs.12000 crore towards expediting various irrigation projects in this perennially drought prone region during the TDP regime, the YSRCP allocated a paltry sum of Rs.2000 odd crore for irrigation works in the Rayalaseema region, which have adversely affected the progress of the projects"", Naidu lamented. ""Though the TDP attracted several investments and established the Orvakal airport, solar power plant etc during our regime, the people of Kurnool gave a landslide victory in 14 out of 14 assembly seats for the YSRCP in the 2019 elections. But in the last five years, the YSRCP hasn't been able to develop the district in any manner and today I'm asking the people to self introspect their decision of voting for the YSRCP in the previous elections"", the TDP chief questioned the people. ""The people of Kurnool should also question the YSRCP about what happened to its promise of establishing Kurnool as the judicial capital of AP. Have they succeeded in establishing the imaginary three capitals in the last five years"", Naidu questioned. Attending the Prajagalam public meeting at Kavali in Nellore district later in the day, the TDP chief assured the fishermen community that the controversial G.O No: 217 which adversely impacted their livelihoods will be scrapped immediately after the TDP comes back to power in the state.

NDA ally NPP won five seats, the same as in 2019, while NCP made a comeback, garnering three. It was a big blow for Congress, which had formed govts in Arunachal’s see-saw politics 8 times between 1980 and 2016. Scripting decisive win , Pema Khandu poised to retain CM’s chair Pema Khandu’s foray into electoral politics was hastened by the unfortunate circumstances of his father and then Arunachal CM Dorjee Khandu’s death in a helicopter crash in 2011. Five years later, he found himself briefly in the hot seat of Arunachal’s last Congress govt, and at the epicentre of a political churn that would quickly see BJP become entrenched in the frontier NorthEastern state. At 44, having just completed his first full term at the helm of a BJP-led govt and presided over a second successive decisive poll victory , Khandu is poised to retain the chief ministership, and possibly the mantle of youngest serving CM of any Indian state. But Khandu is quick to remind everyone that in the absence of a pre-determined face, BJP would follow a structured process to pick the state’s 18th CM. “Ours is a very disciplined party, so no one makes a claim (to the CM’s post). There is a process within the party. The final decision will be made following a meeting of BJP legislature party, which will be attended by a senior central functionary. The party’s choice of CM will be announced after this meeting,” he said in the first flush of victory. Khandu was ranked by the ADR as the second wealthiest CM after Andhra’s YS Jagan Mohan Reddy in 2023. As of Saturday, he had been at the helm for seven years and 321 days. During this period, he was CM of three govts, starting as a Congress CM on July 17, 2016, before switching to People’s Party of Arunachal and taking the oath of office again on Sept 16 of that year. He joined BJP to become CM for the third time on Dec 31, 2016, and continued till the 2019 mandate for his current term. Elected to the assembly unopposed for the first time from his father’s constituency Mukto within months of the latter’s death, Khandu is from the Monpa tribe, an indigenous community that mainly inhabits Tawang district. He is a Buddhist. In 2011, the history graduate from Delhi’s Hindu College was inducted into the then Congress govt led by Jarbom Gamlin as a cabinet minister. The second turning point in his career after his father’s death came in 2016 when a constitutional crisis led to President’s rule. Arunachal victory a testament to people’s trust in PM, says Shah Just one seat for Congress in Arunachal assembly polls illustrates the party’s descent into near-oblivion from the glory days of its longest-serving CM Gegong Apang. In 2019, Congress had four seats. Home minister Amit Shah termed the victory “a testament to the NorthEast people’s trust in PM @narendramodi Ji and the era of change ushered in by the Modi government in the region”. Khandu attributed BJP losing 11 of the seats it had won in 2019 to “local dynamics and tribal politics that are clan-based”. “The future will be better for the party. In the Lok Sabha elections, we will win both seats.” BJP’s performance came in the face of several sitting MLAs switching sides after being denied tickets. Some ended up winning as candidates on the other side. Khandu said the party wouldn’t let any of the turncoats return. “BJP is a mature and professional party, and it cannot allow people to move in and out per their wishes.” On Congress’s decimation, the outgoing CM said it was comeuppance for the grand old party allegedly allowing corruption to strike roots in the region. “Congress has been rooted out, and this is an indication that there is no place for it in Arunachal Pradesh.” Hours after the results were declared, Khandu submitted his resignation to the governor, but was asked to continue till the next govt was formed. Khandu said BJP would stake claim to form the new govt after the Lok Sabha poll verdict on Tuesday.",Times of India,India

A higher-than-expected turnout has made both Congress and BJP claim that people have voted in their favour. “There are two reasons behind the high voter turnout . One is the work put in by BJP ‘ pramukhs ’ and second is the Church circular ,” chief minister Pramod Sawant told TOI. Archbishop Filipe Neri Cardinal Ferrao, in a circular, had asked the Catholics to vote for secular candidates who would uphold values “enshrined in the Constitution”. He had also directed parishes and priests to conduct special prayers. Goa’s turnout is much higher than the national average of 64.5% for the third phase of polls and a political observer attributed it to polarisation among the electorate in the state. BJP visible everywhere, Congress focused on Salcete All eyes are on the South Goa seat where businesswoman Pallavi Dempo of BJP is fighting a pitched battle with Navy veteran Viriato Fernandes of Congress. BJP hopes that by fielding its first woman candidate for the parliamentary polls in Goa, it would be able to project its ‘nari shakti’ slogan and woo women voters. Meanwhile, Viriato, an activist-turned-politician, has turned it into a fight between ‘money power and people’s power’. “We are 100% confident that we will win the South Goa seat. Considering the voting percentage in Salcete constituencies like Velim, Nuvem, Benaulim and Curtorim, which is around 70%, we have a 5% margin with BJP strongholds like Sanvordem, Sanguem, Quepem, Curchorem, Ponda and Marcaim on an average showing 75% voting. With this, we will cover up the difference in Salcete,” Sawant said. In North Goa, Sawant said BJP will get a massive lead in Sattari and Bicholim talukas. If the five-time incumbent MP and Union minister Shripad Naik wins the election, then he would create history by winning the Lok Sabha election for the sixth consecutive term. He and Congress candidate and former Union minister Ramakant Khalap had clashed two and a half decades ago in the Lok Sabha election, resulting in Khalap's defeat. The well-organised machinery of BJP was visible throughout the state except Salcete, where the saffron party’s minimal presence was restricted to one or two constituencies. On the other hand, Congress’s focus was completely on Salcete. GFP president and Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai, who is part of INDIA bloc, said the Lok Sabha election has brought to fore Congress’s organisational failure. “Congress actually doesn’t have an organisation,” he said. But despite Congress having minimal presence on the ground, many of its supporters turned out in large numbers to vote for the party. “According to the report I have received, we are winning both the seats. People have come out in large numbers to vote against BJP,” state Congress president Amit Patkar said. Polling passed off peacefully but was marred in some places by malfunctioning of electronic voting machines. The faulty ones were replaced by the election commission authorities. “You know how Lok Sabha elections are held in Goa. Voters are silent. Most of the people vote for the candidate considering their close connection with the sitting MLA and his performance,” a voter said on condition of anonymity.",Times of India,India

Haryana, a state known for its strong Jat community presence, has a distinctive political environment influenced by powerful voting groups, particularly the Jats, who make up a substantial 29% of the electorate. Jat voters play a crucial role in determining the electoral results in Haryana, especially during the Lok Sabha elections. In the 2019 general elections, BJP achieved a resounding victory, winning all 10 parliamentary seats in the state with a vote share of 58.02%. This triumph in Haryana significantly contributed to BJP's overall success in retaining power at the national level. The opposition parties, such as the Indian National Congress, and regional parties like the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) and the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP), faced a major setback, failing to secure any seats in Haryana. While the BJP is fighting on all 10 seats this time, the Congress has fielded candidates from 9 seats and INDIA party member AAP is contesting from 1 seat. The 10 Lok Sabha seats in Haryana are Ambala, Kurukshetra, Sirsa, Hisar, Karnal, Sonipat, Rohtak, Bhiwani–Mahendragarh, Gurgaon and Faridabad. Despite separating from Jannayak Janta Party, the BJP is in a strong position in Haryana, having been in power for over nine years in the state.

""If we compare the overall development with Gurgaon, Faridabad lacks infrastructure.

Though polling booths in urban areas provided lime water and medical checkups, some rural centres lacked basic arrangements to brave the heat. Many voters were seen covering their heads with dupattas, and in one booth, even mattresses, to shield themselves from the sun. Faridabad parliamentary constituency - dominated by Gurjar, Jat, Punjabi, Brahmin and Meo-Muslim voters - is set to see a straight fight between incumbent Krishan Pal Gurjar of the BJP and Congress's Mahender Pratap Singh. Krishan Pal, also a Union minister of state, is looking to complete a hat-trick from Faridabad, having won the seat twice in a row since 2014.

Youngsters TOI spoke to said they want better education and job opportunities, a supportive startup ecosystem, women's safety and development of civic infrastructure. Devanshu Mishra (21) from Jalvayu Towers said besides govt jobs, there is also a need for more private job opportunities. ""We want secure private jobs too, and a good environment for startups. A lot of people in our age group have ideas for new business opportunities; what we need is a favourable environment to nurture these ideas,"" Mishra added. Another first-time voter, Kamayani (20), a third-year design student who lives in Tatvam Villas, said: ""In applied subjects such as design and technology, there are not enough job opportunities in our country. So, students tend to launch startups and become entrepreneurs. To nurture their business, there must be more govt support, both financial and policy-wise. Though there are some govt startup schemes, many can't access them due to lack of awareness."" Though the initial enthusiasm was somewhat dampened by lengthy queues and the sweltering heat, young voters were excited to cast their first ballot. ""Voting for the first time was a milestone for me, filled with a mix of excitement and responsibility. As I marked my choice on the ballot, I couldn't help but think about the impact my vote would have on shaping the future of my community and country. I expect transparency, accountability, better job opportunities and a genuine commitment to serving the people from the govt,"" said Anannay Singh Dhankhar (18), a resident of Palam Vihar. Anmol Garg (23), a Jalvayu Towers resident who is in the real estate business, said, ""I am voting for a less corrupt country. We, as citizens, run the govt, and it's our responsibility to make it a better society. All the people must come out of their comfort zones to vote for the nation."" New women voters voiced concerns over security and the need to make the roads safer for all. ""I want all roads to be safer for women, especially after evening. In cities like Gurgaon or Delhi, we always travel with fear in the back of our minds, and our parents urge us to come back home early. Whoever comes into power must work on this. As citizens, we want to feel safe. Sanitation services as well as civic amenities need to be improved as well,"" said Taneesha (20), who resides in Sector 52. Others spoke about reservation policies in academic and job platforms. ""Reservations should be based on economic status, rather than caste, in every sector. This will give equal opportunities to all, especially those who can't pursue good career options due to financial reasons,"" said Surya Vihar resident Harsh Sharma (19). ""The quality of education, infrastructure, and teaching learning process at govt institutions need to be improved. Especially at the school level, people prefer private institutions over govt ones. This needs to change,"" said Somya (21), a resident of Sector 56 who too cast her vote for the first time. 2.5L young voters in capital In Delhi, 2,52,038 first-time voters aged 18-19 braved long queues and sweltering heat on Saturday as they made their debut at polling booths.

While the Indian National Congress (INC) is poised to win only 1 seat in the state, predicted ETG. All seats in the state went to the polls in the seventh and last phase of the 2024 Lok Sabha election on Saturday. Himachal Pradesh comprises four Lok Sabha constituencies which are Kangra, Mandi, Hamirpur, and Shimla. A voter turnout of about 68 per cent was recorded on Saturday in the four Lok Sabha constituencies of Himachal Pradesh where polling was held in the last phase of the general election, officials said. Vote counting is scheduled for June 4. In the political arena of Himachal Pradesh, located in the north-west region of India, the two main contenders are the Indian National Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). In the 2019 elections, the BJP clinched all 4 seats in the state with comfortable vote margins above 3.2 lakh in each seat. All the seats also saw a voter turnout of above 70%. However, in the 2021 Lok Sabha bypoll in Mandi, Congress leader Pratibha, wife of former chief minister late Virbhadra Singh, defeated BJP candidate Brigadier Khushal Thakur by a margin of 8,766 votes. In the 2024 elections, the BJP retained its sitting MPs Anurag Thakur (Hamirpur) and Suresh Kumar Kashyap (Shimla-SC), while replacing its sitting Kangra MP (Kishan Kapoor) with Rajeev Bharadwaj, and fielding actor-turned-politician Kangana Ranaut from Mandi. Ranaut is up against Congress heavyweight Vikramaditya Singh, son of Pratibha Singh, and it remains to be seen whether the political greenhorn can successfully take on the scion. The ruling Congress is hoping to translate its 2022 assembly poll victory into a Lok Sabha poll success in all the four seats of Kangra, Hamirpur, Mandi and Shimla. According to the data shared by the Election Commission, there are over 1.70 lakh voters across the state aged between 18 and 19 years who will be voting for the first time.",Times of India,India

Polling in the southern state was held in Phases 2 and 3 i.e., April 26 and May 7. The voter turnout on April 26 for the first 14 Lok Sabha constituencies in Karnataka was estimated to be over 69 per cent, as per poll officials, who reported that approximately 69.23 per cent of eligible voters exercised their right to vote. On May 7, the voting process took place for another 14 Lok Sabha seats in Karnataka. According to poll officials, the voter turnout was quite impressive, with an estimated 70.03% of eligible voters exercising their democratic rights. The officials provided this figure based on the data available until 10.53 pm on the day of the election. The election saw the Congress and BJP once again competing against each other on the electoral stage, less than a year after their previous contest. The two parties are the main contenders in the state, and the outcome of this phase of the Lok Sabha polls could have significant implications for their political fortunes. In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP-led NDA secured 26 seats, with BJP alone claiming 25 seats, while the INC-JD(S) alliance managed only two. Karnataka's 28 constituencies play a pivotal role in national politics, with specific seats reserved for SC and ST candidates.

Efforts to enrol every eligible person shows in the overall (gender) ratio, improvement even among young voters, and the total electorate.

The net incremental share of women voters comes to 93.6 lakh, way above 84.7 lakh increase in men. “...This hints at the cementing of women as the new centre of gravity for Indian politics. 270 constituencies (of 373) witnessed increased participation from 1.2 crore women,” the report states. That is, for every 100 incremental male voters there are 110 incremental female voters voting at any point of time in the first four phases. Also, the increase in absolute votes per constituency in reserved seats continues the lead over general category constituencies, hinting at strengthened roots of participative democracy being all pervasive.",Times of India,India

As per ETG, NDA is poised to win 1 seat in Kerala, while Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) is set to win 19 seats. On the other hand, C-voter predicted 17-19 seats for UDF and 1-3 seats for NDA. Moreover, Axis My India projected that BJP will win 2-3 seats, Congress 13-14 seats, and LDF 0-1 seats.

On the contrary, IPSOS predicted 2-5 seats for Left Democratic Front (LDF), 1-3 seats for BJP, and 15-18 seats for the UDF. The Election Commission of India (ECI) on March 16, 2024, announced the upcoming Lok Sabha election dates. Polling for all the 20 Lok Sabha seats in Kerala took place on April 26, 2024. Like in the past General Elections, Kerala had its elections on a single day, in the second phase of polling of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The election notification was issued on March 28 and the last date for submission of nominations was April 4. As the EC announced the polling date for the Lok Sabha elections 2024, the political landscape in the southern state had been set ablaze with campaigns and strategic maneuvering. With 20 Lok Sabha seats up for grabs, Kerala stands as a crucial battleground where diverse issues ranging from national policies to local issues shaped the electoral discourse. The political discourse surrounding the elections in Kerala was multifaceted, showcasing a mix of national and regional influences. From the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act to the complexities surrounding electoral bonds, and from incidents of ragging to the persistent challenges of man-animal conflicts, the spectrum of issues resonating with voters was broad and diverse. One of the key highlights of the Lok Sabha elections 2024 has been the fierce competition between the Left Democratic Front (LDF) and the Indian National Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF). The LDF, buoyed by its recent performance, fielded heavyweight candidates across the state, sending out a clear message that its alliance within the INDIA bloc holds no importance for the Left coalition in Kerala. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's active involvement in Kerala's electoral landscape injected a new dimension into the campaign dynamics. With frequent visits aimed at bridging the north-south political divide, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) wanted to expand its footprint in the state, posing a formidable challenge to established players. In the high-profile constituency of Wayanad, all eyes are set on the battle between Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and LDF's Annie Raja, symbolizing a clash of political titans. Similarly, in Thiruvananthapuram, the contest between Congress's Shashi Tharoor and LDF's Pannian Raveendran promises an intense electoral showdown. Thrissur also emerges as a closely observed constituency with three prominent contenders. The Congress has fielded K Muraleedharan, a decision made amidst the backdrop of his sister, Padmaja Venugopal, defecting to the BJP from the Congress. Prime Minister Narendra Modi personally inaugurated the NDA's campaign in January, endorsing actor-turned-politician Suresh Gopi. Meanwhile, VS Sunil Kumar, representing the CPI, enjoys familiarity among the electorate in the Thrissur constituency. In the 2019 elections, Alappuzha was the only constituency where the CPI(M) managed to secure a victory. However, in 2024 polls, the Congress has asserted its presence in the region by fielding a heavyweight candidate, KC Venugopal, who serves as the AICC general secretary. Kerala holds the 12th rank in terms of the number of Lok Sabha seats, comprising a total of 20 constituencies. Among these, 18 are unreserved, while two are reserved for Scheduled Caste (SC) candidates. In the 2019 Parliamentary elections, the United Democratic Front (UDF) emerged victorious in 19 out of the 20 seats. The lone seat secured by the Left Democratic Front (LDF) was in Alappuzha, won by the CPI(M).",Times of India,India

""There is a conspiracy involving the top leadership behind the creation of that message, its circulation and the date of its release,"" said Siddique, adding that CPM's attempts to play victim over the issue is shameful. He said instead of taking up people's issues, CPM conducted its campaign by putting forward a divisive manifesto that was reflected in newspaper ads and the party's campaign. He added CPM should not have undertaken a communal campaign in a place like Vadakara instead of applying balm on the wounds of its past. Siddique said the enlightened people of Vadakara were not swayed by this and the people saw the true face of CPM. He said police should take serious note of the statements and personal insults being spread in Vadakara. Siddique said UDF will organize a drive against CPM's communal campaign on May 11. Also, Siddique refuted reports that UDF candidate M K Raghavan had complained against him at KPCC's leadership meeting in connection with his election campaigning. ""I was also at KPCC's meeting and he did not speak against me. Such reports are part of efforts to create issues in Congress and create rifts between people; it won't succeed,"" he said.

It is mysterious the memory card inside the bus went missing during the dispute between the mayor and the KSRTC driver. It disappeared amid allegations that the mayor's husband and MLA Sachin Dev got into the bus and asked passengers to get down. It is suspected the memory card was deliberately removed and destroyed, fearing it would provide evidence against them, said Satheesan. ""It should also be checked whether there is a political conspiracy behind the disappearance of the memory card, which would have been a crucial piece of evidence in the case,'' said Satheesan. It is unacceptable that no case has been registered against the mayor and MLA for violating law. Registering a case based on a complaint from the mayor, and dismissing the complaint given by the driver is double standards of justice. The police and the KSRTC management have committed serious errors regarding the incident, he added. KSRTC officials did not respond even after the mayor caused hindrance to movement of the bus in the middle of the city and asked all passengers to get down without completing their journey for which they had paid. ""Doesn't KSRTC have responsibility towards the victims? Despite cancelling the trip, no complaint was lodged with the police. Will this be the approach of KSRTC if a common man does this? Or do the mayor and MLA have any privilege? Whose interest the KSRTC is protecting by not filing a complaint against the mayor and her team?'' asked Satheesan. The mayor and her family had got into a heated argument with the KSRTC bus driver last Saturday night after allegedly blocking the vehicle at Palayam junction. Rajendran claimed the KSRTC bus was not blocked, but CCTV visuals aired by television channels showed her private car parked across the zebra line on the road. She had said she spoke to the driver while the bus was stopped at the red signal area to raise her protest against his alleged sexually suggestive gestures towards her and her sister-in-law.

The BJP, which won comprehensively in the 2023 assembly elections, had replaced Shivraj Singh Chouhan as the chief minister of the state with Mohan Yadav, keeping an eye on the caste equations. The Congress also removed party veteran and former chief minister Kamal Nath as state chief after assembly election drubbing and made Jitu Patwari the new MP chief. If the exit poll predictions come true on June 4, when the votes will be counted, it would mean continued dominance of BJP in the state politics. The Election Commission declared the schedule for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections on March 16, setting the stage for an intense political contest across the country.

It ensured anonymity, preventing any particular company's name from being associated with a specific party. If a company purchases electoral bonds, this transaction may be reflected in the company's balance sheet. Therefore, electoral bonds were a step towards transparency. Even though the Supreme Court has now disclosed everyone's names, I still stand by the belief that this was a step in the right direction.""

The impact of the work carried out by NPP in the last 6 years is evident, particularly in Garo Hills. The public will vote for the NPP for the development initiatives undertaken. Our MP, Agatha Sangma, has made significant contributions to these development efforts. Therefore, we urge the people to come forward and support our MP.

She also said the results were an indication of what’s about to happen in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls , doubting whether the saffron party would manage to get even 100 votes in all. “People want change,” Banerjee said, repeating that there should be one-to-one contests against the BJP in next year’s polls. “Discussions are on. Wherever which party — it may be national or regional — is strong, let there be a one-to-one-contest. What is the harm?” she said. Banerjee said that people had started to reject BJP’s “brute authoritarian and majoritarian politics”. “Why will people vote for the BJP?... What is the requirement of a governor house (in states)? I am not talking about my governor. Everywhere, state money is being misused, bills are pending and the governor is sending reports of opposition parties to the Centre,” she said, adding, “Everyone is facing agencies. I have no problems with those who are really criminals..... Even I think the courts, the judges’ system, the judiciary which can save us, but that also... judiciary must care about that... sometimes the lower court and high court interfere like anything. The road from Bengal led to Bengaluru today, says Didi CM Mamata Banerjee, reacting to the Karnataka results, said the “arrogant” BJP had crossed its peak. “They had got close to the 300-mark. But now I do not think they will cross even 100 (in 2024),” she said, ad- ding, “I salute the win- ners, even Kumaraswa- my ji, has also done well. Elections are due in Chhattisgarh and Mad- hya Pradesh. I think BJP will lose both states.” Banerjee said, barring “Yogi-raj in Uttar Pradesh”, which she called “atrocityraj”, BJP had just Gujarat and Haryana. “Where will they get the seats (in 2024)?” South India — Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka — were not with BJP, the CM said. Likewise, in east India, Bihar, Bengal and Jharkhand were not with them. “This time, maybe Odisha, too, will think it over,” she said, adding, “In the north, too, Delhi and Punjab are not with them.” Trinamool’s national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee said Bengal had rejected the politics of religion and divisiveness in 2021. “Karnataka has done it in 2023, India will do it in 2024. A campaign based on religion, love jihad, what people will wear, what people will eat... these can never be political issues. Political issues should be about roads, health, jobs,” he said. “The antiBJP votes must not be split between opposition parties. They must fend off the BJP on their respective turfs.” The CM said that the BJP “cannot control everybody”. “It is not a government of the people, but of one ruler, one party, one ideology, agency, one motto, and vendetta. I think people will not accept this. The road from Bengal led to Bengaluru today. The people’s mandate is clear: if you do not have a prelude to a song, mere decking up and taking the stage does not make a good tune. The song has to have melody, a rhythm.” When early leads indica- ted Congress were on course to win, the CM Tweeted: “My salutations to the people of Karnataka for their decisive mandate in favour of change!! Brute authoritarian and ma- joritarian politics is vanquis- hed!! When people want plura- lity and democratic forces to win, no central design to do- minate can repress their spon- taneity: that is moral of the story, lesson for tomorrow.”",Times of India,India

While top Congress leaders held a meeting on Mizoram with state party leaders, chief minister issued a fervent appeal for restoration of peace and normalcy in Manipur. Mizoram will go to election later this year along with four other states - Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Telangana and Chhattisgarh. In a meeting on Mizoram held in the national capital, president Mallikarjun Kharge , former president Shri Rahul Gandhi , general secretary (organisation) KC Venugopal, Mizoram in-charge Bhakta Charan Dass and leaders from that state participated at All India Congress Committee (AICC) headquarters. Later, Kharge, in a tweet, said, “Our fellow citizens of Mizoram desire change. Congress party has a record of providing stability and progress in the state, and @INCMizoram is once again ready to herald a new era of development and welfare in Mizoram. We will do everything possible to work towards that.” Venugopal, in a tweet, said, ""Attended the strategy meeting for the upcoming Mizoram assembly elections at AICC HQ, headed by AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge along with Rahul Gandhi. The BJP and NEDA (Northeast Development Agency) have completely ruined the Northeast . The Congress is the only party that can serve the true interests of Mizoram as well as all other northeastern states."" Coincidentally, perhaps, Mizoram CM Zoramthanga posted a long tweet raising concern over the continued violence in the neighbouring state of Manipur and seeking help from the Centre for the refugees from that state as well as bordering Myanmar and Bangladesh. Zoramthanga started by saying that the onset of May witnessed a brutal, untoward and uncalled-for incident in Manipur. “At this very moment, 3:30 am, July 4, 2023; nothing seems to have changed. We are counting, and today is the 62nd day.” The Mizoram CM said, “While we hope with much goodwill, anticipation and hope, things would turn for the better, situations seem to have worsened. When will it stop? I condole my Manipuri Zo ethnic brethen, my incessant prayers for those who have lost their loved ones, their homes and families wrecked in shatters. May the gracious Lord give you the strength and the wisdom to navigate through this disastrous incident.” Zoramthanga said he did not wish to see anymore pictures and video clips of churches being burnt, brutal killings and violence of all nature, regardless of gender and age. “If there is only one way of settling for peace, shall we opt for that? Many lives have been lost, bloodshed all over, physical torture and the victims are looking for refuge wherever possible. With no iota of doubt, those victims are my kin and kin, my own blood and should we quieten the situation by just being silent? I don't think so!” He said he would like to call for immediate restoration of peace and normalcy. It is incumbent and imperative upon those responsible and law-abiding citizens or entities of the country to look for immediate ways for peace restoration. Development with a human touch and ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’ applies to the Zo ethnic tribes in Manipur too, he said. Regarding the fallout of the ongoing Manipur violence, he said it has resulted in internally displaced people (IDP) to the tune of 12,000 in Mizoram. “Refugees and/ or IDPs from Manipur, Myanmar and Bangladesh have risen to over 50,000. I wish and pray that the central government, on humanitarian grounds, lend us an immediate helping hand,” he said, tagging his Manipur counterpart N Biren Singh with the hashtag ‘All lives matter’. Manipur has been witnessing violence since May 3. It has killed more than 130 people while several houses have been burnt and massive destruction to property has been caused. Union home minister Amit Shah was in the state for five days from May 29 to June 2. He also convened a meeting in the national capital on June 24 to take stock of the situation in the state. A day later, Manipur CM Biren SIngh called on him in Delhi. Rahul Gandhi also paid a two-day visit to Manipur starting June 29. He visited relief camps in Churachandpur district on June 29. The next day, he went to Moirang in Bishnupur district. Before meeting governor Anusuiya Uikey, he also interacted with women, intellectuals and representatives of student bodies.

Zoramthanga, also the ruling Mizo National Front (MNF) president, said that his party believes that UCC is in conflict with the religious and social practices of the Mizos and their customary laws that are protected by the Art 371(G) of the Constitution. The MNF is a constituent of the BJP-led North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA), the regional version of the NDA. Zoramthanga's statement came days after Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad K Sangma , whose party NPP is also a member of NEDA, asserted that the UCC ""in its present form"" is against the idea of India. ""Since the proposed implementation of UCC throughout the territory of India is in conflict with the religious and social practices of the Mizos and of their customary/personal law which is specifically protected by constitutional provision, the said proposal of the NDA government at the Centre as can be seen in the Law commission notice cannot be accepted,"" Zoramthanga said in his letter. Last month, the Law Commission issued a public notice inviting views from various stakeholders on the UCC under the "" Review of Personal Laws "" subject. The chief minister said that MNF supports the policies and programmes of the NDA government at the Centre as long as those are found to be beneficial for the public at large and particularly for the ethnic minorities in the country. Zoramthanga also said that Article 371(G) of the Constitution states that no act of Parliament in respect of religious or social practices of the Mizos, Mizo customary law and procedure, ownership and transfer of land, shall apply to Mizoram unless the state legislature by a resolution so decides. Zoramthanga informed the Law Commission that the Mizoram assembly had passed an official resolution on February 14 opposing any step towards enactment of the UCC in the country. The said resolution was moved, discussed and thereafter unanimously adopted by the state assembly for the reasons that the UCC, if enacted, ""would disintegrate the country as it was an attempt to terminate the religious or social practices, customary laws, culture and traditions of the religious minorities, including the Mizos,"" he said in the letter. Meanwhile, the Mizoram Kohhran Hruaitute Committee, a conglomerate of church leaders' bodies in the state, also wrote to the Union Law Commission that it strongly opposed implementation of UCC in the country. The Committee claimed in its letter that the UCC is detrimental to the unity in diversity of Indian culture, religions and customs and is undermining the rights and privileges of the Mizos enshrined in Article 371(G) of the Constitution. The Nagaland Tribal Council late last month had also written to the Law Commission that the UCC, if implemented, will dilute the provisions of Article 371A of the Constitution which states about special provisions for the state. Uniform Civil Code is aimed at replacing personal laws based on religions, customs, and traditions with one common law for everyone irrespective of religion, caste, creed, sexual orientation, and gender. Personal laws and laws related to inheritance, adoption and succession are likely to be covered by a common code. Implementation of a UCC has been part of BJP election manifestos.",Times of India,India

While former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal was alive, he used to take care of the election campaign of his daughter-in-law. Senior leaders of alliance partner Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) too used to campaign for alliance candidates. This time, the SAD is contesting alone and after the demise of Badal Sr, the onus of taking ahead the party campaign lies more on the shoulders of Sukhbir than anyone else. He has spent a considerable time in Bathinda constituency concentrating on all nine assembly segments with special focus on Lambi assembly segment, which was earlier being represented by the late chief minister, before he lost to Gurmeet Singh Khudian of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in 2022 state assembly elections. Khudian is now the AAP nominee in these parliamentary elections. Senior leaders of the AAP and the BJP too have campaigned in Bathinda. Defence minister Rajnath Singh campaigned for party candidate while another Union minister Smirti Irani was due to campaign but her chopper could not land in Mansa a couple of days ago. From the AAP, party national convener Arvind Kejriwal came twice while chief minister Bhagwant Mann covered all the nine assembly segments and wherever across Punjab he went, he stressed more on “snatching Bathinda seat” from the SAD and even prepared a comic poem (Kikli) showcasing that Akali Dal has lost grip on Bathinda even as the Akali Dal considers this seat its stronghold. Fourth Time Lucky? In 2009 and 2014 Harsimrat won when Akali Dal was ruling in the state by defeating ex-CM Captain Amarinder Singh’ son Raninder Singh and ex-finance minister Badal. In 2019, while the Congress was ruling in Punjab, she defeated Amrinder Singh Raja Warring of the Congress, who is contesting from Ludhiana. Both Sukhbir and Harsimrat reiterated that all their opponents are controlled from Delhi who could never be true friends or sympathisers of Punjab and Punjabis. While taking on the Congress, they said that the day of June 1 reminded Punjab and Sikhs of the Army attack on Golden Temple exactly 40 years ago and no true Sikh should vote for that party. Taking on the AAP, they said that “jharu (broom) wali party” is increasing debt on Punjab as money is being spent in other states to take the party ahead. Addressing a rally in Mansa, Sukhbir said the loyalty of SAD is with Punjab and not any alliance. “We will stick to our agenda for our people instead of toeing that of any other party or bloc. Safeguarding the pride and interests of Punjab is more important to us,” he said. Addressing rallies in Sardulgarh, Budhlada and Mansa, Sukhbir said that he had covered more than 80 assembly segments during the two-month-long Punjab Bachao Yatra which traversed 3,200 km in the state. “I have talked to farmers, labourers, traders and industrialists and seen the anger of people against the AAP govt. People told me they feel cheated by Delhi parties, including Congress and BJP.

A day after the polling in West Tripura and the by-poll in Ramnagar, the main opposition Congress and CPI-M separately demanded a countermand of the elections and to hold fresh polling, alleging that BJP-backed miscreants didn’t allow opposition agents in more than 80 percent of booths. A sizable number of opposition voters in each of the 30 assembly segments were prevented from voting with the help of the election machinery and security forces. Proxy voting was carried out at maximum polling stations, and several polling booths had registered higher voting than the actual number of voters.

The MLC constituency is spread over 34 assembly constituencies in the three erstwhile districts, where the ruling Congress has a majority of MLAs. MLC polls a prestige battle for key parties Though there are 52 candidates in the fray, the main contest is likely to be between Congress, BJP and BRS nominees. The MLC constituency was won by BRS in 2021. The bypoll was necessitated following resignation of BRS sitting MLC Palla Rajeshwar Reddy after he won the Jangaon seat in 2023 assembly polls. Chintapandu Naveen, popularly known as Teenmar Mallanna, from Congress, G Premender Reddy of BJP and A Rakesh Reddy of BRS are the three main contenders among the 52 contestants. Important leaders from Congress, including ministers, BJP state president G Kishan Reddy and Eatala Rajender and BRS working president K T Rama Rao and former minister T Harish Rao campaigned for their respective party candidates. For the ruling Congress, it is a matter of prestige to win the bypoll and has gone all out to impress upon the graduate voters in the constituency. BJP and BRS too are confident of winning the seat as BJP had secured fourth place pushing the Congress to fifth spot in the 2021 election. BRS had won this seat then. However, political equations have changed since the people voted Congress to power in the state in 2023 assembly polls. In 2021, Telangana Jana Samiti (TJS) chief Kodandaram also contested the poll and finished third.

For residents of Seku, which is yet to be connected with a proper road, their miseries, as 64-year-old Bhagwat Singh Rawat, says, ""can be measured in kilometres"".","UTTARKASHI: Nestled in the lap of the mighty Himalayas , Seku village of Uttarkashi district in Uttarakhand is populated predominantly by Rawats (Thakurs) with a handful of families from Schedule Caste groups. For residents of Seku, which is yet to be connected with a proper road, their miseries, as 64-year-old Bhagwat Singh Rawat, says, “can be measured in kilometres”. One has to trek 3km to reach the nearest motorable road, the Sangamchatti-Gangori road, and the nearest inter college — at Bhankholi — is 7km away. “The closest PHC at Gajoli village is around 4km, and to meet our daily requirements we have to go to the Cheevan market 5km away,” said Bhagwat Singh. Seku, in the Assi Ganga valley of Bhatwari block, has over the decades witnessed temporary as well as permanent migration. When Uttarakhand went to polls this time, on April 19, the village (which falls in the Tehri Lok Sabha constituency) mostly kept away. Out of the 200 people eligible to vote, only 11 cast their ballots. “We all had the same complaint,” Bhagwat Singh said. “People openly announced, ‘no road’, no vote’. All of us maintained a distance (from the polling booth). We have a long pending demand that has to be fulfilled first. We need a road to connect the village to the Sangamchatti-Gangori route.” Bhagwat said, “I have always voted but there comes a time when you have to think about your family, future generations and the village. If we succumb to pressure today (to vote), our children will suffer in the absence of a road.” Prior to the 2014 polls, Bhagwat and his family had supported Congress but in the last one decade they have put their weight behind the BJP. “Unfortunately, be it the Congress or BJP, no MP has visited our village since the state was created in 2000 (after being carved out of UP).” While Bhagwat’s elder son Manoj is involved in agriculture on their 5-bigha land, his younger son Sunil is a tour guide at Rishikesh who makes it a point to return to the village during the off-season. However, in the absence of a proper school and health facilities at Seku, the families of Manoj and Sunil live in Uttarkashi town. The key concern for Bhagwat’s wife Jayendri Devi, meanwhile, is the “mysterious absence of local issues and matters related to women” during campaigning for the Lok Sabha polls. “Where was the talk around daily problems faced by us? Why are our votes being sought if our opinion and hardships do not matter. Life for women is extremely tough in the hills but no candidate is willing to discuss it,” she said. “For those who don’t move out, life in the mountains is hard,” said Manoj. “And to make things harder, travel takes so much of our time and energy. Govts should give infrastructure in the hills some thought — roads, schools, hospitals.” Sunil is quick to agree. “Our village faces a plethora of problems with connectivity being at the centre of all our worries. We are 15km away from the district headquarters. Most youth have migrated to nearby towns as agriculture is our main source of earning but the produce is often damaged by wild animals. Most of our problems can be solved if we get good roads. It will not only lead to tourist arrivals but also help in transportation of agricultural produce to markets elsewhere.”",Times of India,India

OPS’s legal battle for the AIADMK leadership has so far come to naught with the Election Commission acknowledging the group led by his rival, AIADMK general secretary Edappadi K Palaniswami in April. The lone election win of Ravindhranath in the mukkulathor-dominant Theni Lok Sabha constituency was something Panneerselvam had been flaunting in Delhi. He has successfully thwarted his opponents’ attempts to make his son an “unattached member” in Parliament after being expelled from the party in July last year. Many believe OPS has been playing his politics around himself and his son. “OPS ditched his long-time loyalists and worked only for his son’s victory in 2019. The high court judgment is a big blow to OPS; it’s a setback for the AIADMK too,” said former AIADMK MP K C Palanisamy. With this, the AIADMK, which was the third largest party in Parliament with more than 50 MPs at the time of J Jayalalithaa’s death, now has none. Panneerselvam’s intent to get a ministerial berth for his son did not fructify as infighting in the party took an ugly turn soon after the Modi government took charge in 2019. Ravindhranath chose to deviate from the party’s official stand, and Edappadi Palaniswami warned him when the MP endorsed triple talaq and the Motor Vehicle Bill in the Lok Sabha. Ravindhranath served as a bridge for his dad to reach out to the high and mighty in Delhi. The BJP camp, meanwhile, has adopted a wait-and-watch policy till the 2024 general elections near.

'No Euphoria Around Ram Mandir' 3 days ago 00:58 Democracy at Risk: Kejriwal Sounds Alarm as Opposition Fractures and BJP's Power Surge Threatens Constitution 3 days ago 1 2 3 4 5 6 For two-time MP and former Union minister Tewari, 58, it is a homecoming he has been waiting for since 2009 polls. Born and raised in the city, Tewari learnt his first political lessons here. But since 1991, Congress brass kept its faith in its veteran functionary Pawan Kumar Bansal , who maintained a tight hold and resisted any new entrant in the city’s political landscape. Bansal won four of the eight elections he contested in, including three wins on the trot in 1999, 2004 and 2009. In the last two Lok Sabha polls, he suffered major defeats at the hands of BJP’s actorturned-politician Kirron Kher , who has also grown up in the city. For BJP’s Tandon, 60, the wait for nomination has been long and bitter. In 2014, he was the lead contender, but the party’s national leadership sprang a surprise by declaring Kher as candidate. There were internal squabbles and protests, but Tandon, the Chandigarh BJP state president at the time, went along with the party’s decision. Riding the Modi wave, Kher won easily in 2014 and 2019 elections. But relations between Tandon and Kher have remained cold if not bitter. This time, with Kher struggling with health issues and anti-incumbency at its peak, the party finally decided to repose its faith in Tandon. Man-To-Man Fight Within the overarching campaign narratives of ‘democracy in danger’ vs ‘10 years of vikas’, the Chandigarh campaign is also driven by the personality and background of the two candidates. Tewari, son of a noted educationist, poet and a former Rajya Sabha member V N Tewari, is a full-bred Congressman, having risen through the ranks — president of National Students Union of India from 1986 to 1993 and president of Indian Youth Congress from 1998 to 2003. On the other end, Tandon’s roots run deep in BJP and Sangh Parivar. His father, Balram Das Tandon, was an RSS pracharak and founding member of the Bharatiya Jan Sangh in 1951. Tandon learnt his first ideological lessons in the Sangh’s shakhas. His first major political responsibility was in 1991 when he was put in charge of the party’s Lok Sabha campaign. Despite being overlooked by BJP for the Chandigarh ticket, Tandon continued to work at the grassroot level building close relationships within the cadre and also with major stake holders and interest groups across the city. With Kher accused of being inaccessible and not on good terms with the Chandigarh administration, particularly in the last five years, party workers and residents have turned to Tandon. He has become the link between residents and administration. After Tewari was chosen Congress candidate, Tandon was quick to flaunt his wellcultivated connection, and labelled his rival an “outsider”. BJP also termed Tewari as a “bhagora” (runaway) for frequently changing his constituencies. “Where are you running off to in 2029?” is a rhetoric raised by Tandon in his campaigns. Tewari was Congress MP from Ludhiana in 2009, didn’t contest 2014 elections, and in 2019 was elected from Punjab’s Anandpur Sahib seat. However, Tewari’s poll pitch is that even though he was representing other constituencies, he still lives in Chandigarh and has funded several projects in the city through his MPLAD funds and raised issues related to the city in Parliament. His supporters are also quick to remind, “He is a son of the soil. His father was killed in Chandigarh by terrorists (in 1984).” Tewari has also raked up Tandon’s connection with disgraced BJP-nominated councillor Anil Masih, who was castigated by Supreme Court for his role in denying INDIA bloc victory in Chandigarh mayoral elections. Attacking Tandon, Tewari has said, “A vote for Tandon is a vote for Masih.” BJP Loses An Ally, Cong Gains One For the first time, Congress is contesting Chandigarh elections in alliance with AAP. In 2014, AAP had dented Congress’ vote share by garnering nearly 24% of the total votes polled. Congress’ vote share shrank by 20% from 2009. In 2019, AAP got only 4% of votes. Congress recovered around 13% of the lost vote share. BJP and its long-time ally, Shiromani Akali Dal, have parted ways this elections. Akalis, who hardly have a base in the constituency, had nominated their Chandigarh MC councillor Hardeep Singh as candidate but he gave up his ticket and quit the party, claiming no Akali leader was supporting him. He later joined AAP. BJP also suffered its first electoral setback in a decade in Chandigarh in the 2021 municipal corporation elections. AAP became the single largest party, followed by BJP and Congress, a development that may help Tewari. Changing Voter Base Rehabilitation colonies and villages, with nearly half of the city’s 6.6 lakh voters, are key to victory. They also have a higher propensity to get out and vote than those living in the sectorial grid. Migrants from Bihar and UP make up a major chunk of colonies and village voters. Issues like village and colony infrastructural development, regularisation of constructions outside lal dora, relief for building violations, traffic congestion, parking woes and ownership rights have consequently gained primacy in this election. And both candidates are on the same page regarding these issues.",Times of India,India

Even as senior leaders from the big parties - Congress, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) - are descending on Punjab to give the final push to the campaigning, over 20 activists from Tamil Nadu and other states are adding a different colour to the campaigning. Tamil-origin Sikh Jeevan Singh, who heads Bahujan Dravida Party (BDP) and earlier fielded seven Tamil origin Sikhs in their home state, is contesting the election from the reserved constituency. Selva Singh and Ranjan Singh, who contested the election in Tamil Nadu, brought their mopeds with them which are also being used in the campaign in nearby areas. They told TOI that they brought these along in their train journey from Kanyakumari to Delhi from where they further drove these to Raipur village, around 10 kms from Hoshirapur. The other paraphernalia include a computer, printer, small public address system, a video camera and a few other things to begin the work with minimal resources of their party. The entire team is camping here at a house in the village, in the vicinity of a gurdwara. Two of them are also from Kerala. As they go out campaigning daily, the teams mix either with those of the group who know Hindi or the local activists who know Punjabi. Working on minimal resources, they go to small groups in villages, distribute the pamphlets informing voters about their party, the candidate and the fundamental ideology of their party. The posters and pamphlets contain pictures of the great Sikh warrior Banda Singh Bahadur, Periyar, BSP founder Kanshi Ram and other Dalit icons . Advocate Ashok Saket from Madhya Pradesh's Satna Satna understands Punjabi as he has been visiting the state for the last 12 years in connection with his activism in Bahujan politics. He often translates when Jeevan Singh speaks in English in meetings with groups here. Adivasi woman activist Jarnail Kaur - earlier Tarika Tarangini from Raigarh district in Chattisgarh, who became Sikh during farm protests at Singhu border after staying there for quite some time - is also accompanying the group. Sitha Kaur from Tamil Nadu is the other woman member of the group. ""Quite a few local Sikhs are also joining us and they are helping in our campaigning. Most of the support is coming from Sikh groups of diverse backgrounds. Noted intellectuals of the community have also extended support to us,"" Jeevan Singh says. Noted Sikh author and former IAS officer Gurtej Singh and Kendri Sri Guru Singh Sabha, Chandigarh president Prof Sham Singh had joined Jeevan Singh when he filed nomination papers. ""Apart from noted names in the Sikh community, Sikh activists who are active on ground are also supporting us,"" said BDP state president Tirath Singh.",Times of India,India

Kejriwal: BJP will once more face anger of Punjabis Kejriwal said, “You witnessed the anger of people when you stopped farmers from marching to Delhi by fixing nails on the roads in 2021. You will face the anger of Punjabis again.” The Delhi CM reiterated his charges of democracy in danger, claiming “BJP wants to retain power by putting leaders from opposition in jail.” “The BJP govt aimed to stop AAP by putting its leaders in prison. In Maharashtra, it ensured divisions in NCP and Shiv Sena. It put former Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren in jail and is now talking about putting RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav in jail. Like Pakistan, where elections were held after imprisoning former Prime Minister Imran Khan, and in Russia, where Vladimir Putin jailed his opponents to win elections, the same atmosphere is being created in the country. Under such circumstances, if Modi is not defeated, democracy cannot be saved,” said Kejriwal. Kejriwal claimed that the aim of BJP is to topple AAP govt and stop the free electricity being given to people of the state. “If you want to continue free electricity, make AAP win all 13 seats of Punjab, otherwise BJP will stop your free electricity. If we have more MPs in Parliament, we will be able to fight the central govt and continue the free electricity and other facilities,” he said. Accusing BJP of dividing parties, making lawmakers resign, engineering defections and resorting to malpractices, a s seen in the Chandigarh mayoral election, Mann said the BJP was speaking of toppling state govts. “Punjabis made maximum sacrifices for the country but instead of rewarding the state, they are threatening us. They want everyone to bow before the Delhi darbar. We don’t fear anyone. People have made up their mind to stand by AAP. We will come out as a big force on June 4,” said Mann, adding BJP thinks that everyone could be purchased but they must keep it in mind that “we (AAP) are not saleable.” Hitting out at the PM for his election campaign speeches, Mann said that although Hindi language has a vast vocabulary, Modi knowns only 10 words, “Hindustan-Pakistan, mandirmasjid, manglasutra-Muslim, kabristan-shamshan ghat and cow-buffalo”. “He is doing politics of hatred and polarisation. In 2014, he called himself a pradhan sewak, became a chowkidar in 2019 and now proclaims himself to be an avatar of god,” he said. While campaigning for AAP Ferozepur Lok Sabha seat candidate Jagdeep Singh Kaka Brar in Abohar, Mann said the state govt has started supplying canal water for irrigation of cotton fields in the area. “For us, Abohar is not the tail end (of canals) but comes first. It is the tail end when you see it from Chandigarh,” he said. Mann said efforts were on to make canal water available for irrigation across the state to cut the reliance on tubewells in order to save groundwater. The CM said he had big plans for bringing food processing companies to Ferozepur. “Kinnows will have a market in Punjab. The state govt will serve kinnows in mid-day meals at schools. We buy bananas from Kerala for children, and now, we will give them our kinnows from Abohar and litchis from Pathankot,” he said.",Times of India,India

The Delhi high court had declined any interim relief to Kejriwal and only issued notice on his plea challenging the arrest and remand.

Malhotra replaced cricketer-turned-politician and East Delhi MP Gautam Gambhir, who urged BJP chief JP Nadda to relieve him of political duties ahead of the polls citing his commitments related to cricket. Meanwhile, Chandolia, former mayor of North Delhi, replaced Punjabi folk singer Hans Raj Hans . Malhotra is the former mayor of the erstwhile East Delhi Municipal Corporation. After the announcement of his candidature, Malhotra thanked Delhi BJP chief Virendra Sachdeva for giving him an opportunity. ""I want to thank Delhi BJP chief Virendra Sachdeva for giving a chance to a worker. I will live up to his expectations. There is no competition as to when we will talk about the works of PM Modi, people will support us..."" Malhotra said. Earlier, on March 2, the BJP announced the first list including 5 names from Delhi. The first list includes Bansuri Swaraj, Praveen Khandelwal, Manoj Tiwari,Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, and Kamaljeet Sehrawat. Those dropped on the first list included former Union health minister Harsh Vardhan (Chandni Chowk), Union minister Meenakshi Lekhi (New Delhi), former Delhi CM Sahib Singh Verma’s son Parvesh Verma (West Delhi), and Ramesh Bidhuri (South Delhi). State BJP president Virendra Sachdeva in a post on X congratulated Malhotra and Chandolia on being declared as party candidates. ""Modi in heart, Modi in Delhi Hearty congratulations and best wishes to Harsh Malhotra on being declared the MP candidate from East Delhi and Yogendra Chandoliaon being declared the MP candidate from North-West Delhi. The people of Delhi are ready to make Modi ji Prime Minister for the third time by giving all seven seats to BJP,"" Sachdeva said in a post. The BJP is pitted against INDIA bloc partners the AAP and Congress in Delhi for the upcoming polls. Under a seat-sharing agreement, the AAP is contesting four - East Delhi, New Delhi, South Delhi and West Delhi constituencies. The Congress is yet to announce its candidates on remaining three - North East Delhi, Chandni Chowk and North West Delhi seats it got from its Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) bloc partner AAP.",Times of India,India

Earlier, the Anantnag-Rajouri was scheduled for polling on May 7 but the EC later postponed it to May 26 citing adverse weather conditions. According to the Election Commission of India , J&K recorded the highest ever voter turnout in the general elections in the past 35 years with 58.46% In the valley, the three parliamentary constituencies—Srinagar, Baramulla, and Anantnag-Rajouri—achieved voter turnout rates of 38.49%, 59.1%, and 54.84% respectively, marking the highest in the last three decades. Meanwhile, the other two constituencies in the Union Territory, Udhampur and Jammu, recorded voter turnout rates of 68.27% and 72.22% respectively. Earlier Ladakh was also a parliamentary constituency of J&K until it was declared to be a separate UT in 201. Many have eyes on poll outcomes in J&K as it’ll be the first general elections after the central government made the decision to scrap Article 370 of the Constitution which gave special status to the state. In 2019, NDA won 2 seats and JKNC won 3 seats while the Ladakh (part of J&K at the time) seat was won by BJP.

The comparison may however not be perfect as the geographical limits of Anantnag had undergone some significant changes during delimitation in 2020-21, with parts of Jammu division's Rajouri district added to it. EC on Monday termed the high turnout in J&K a testament to robust democratic spirit and civil engagement of its people. ""The voter turnout of 50.86% from the three seats in Kashmir Valley echoes the faith of the people in the democratic process,"" it said in a statement. Chief commissioner Rajiv Kumar, while thanking the voters of J&K, stated: ""This achievement sits on a credible wave of 25% increase in the number of contesting candidates since 2019, C-vigil complaints showing enhnaced citizen involvement and Suvidha portal showing 2,455 requests for rallies etc, reflecting the steady retaking of the election and campaign space away from hesitation and to fuller particpation"". EC sought to attribute the high turnout by the younger voters in the age group 18-39 years. This particular age category accounted for 56% of the electorate in Baramulla, 48.6% in Srinagar, 54.4% in Anantnag-Rajouri and 47.7% in Jammu. Also, 26 special polling stations - including 21 in Jammu, 4 in Delhi, and 1 at Udhampur - were set up to facilitate voting by displaced Kashmiri migrants.

Other activities included creating Igloos as a dummy polling station in Baramulla, para scooter event in Kathua, mega awareness rallies in Teetwal near LOC, near Dal Lake in Srinagar to Chougan in Kishtwar and playing instrumental version of ECI song on the highest railway bridge.

A three-cornered election in Ladakh, with the BJP and the Congress candidates from Leh and an Independent nominee from Kargil, gives an edge to the Kargil candidate. In an interview with PTI, Lakruk stressed the need for safeguards to protect the land and culture of Ladakh, and also raised concerns over the pasture lands, used for grazing by the local nomadic tribes, being taken over by China.

The Sixth Schedule of the Constitution deals with provisions for the administration of the tribal areas in the states of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram. Founded in 1933, the LBA had raised the demand for making Ladakh a separate state soon after Independence. However, it was included in Jammu and Kashmir at that time. But the demand for a separate identity continued. ""After the abrogation of Article 370, there were celebrations initially. But then we realised it is not good for us,"" Lakruk told PTI. He said various social, religious and other organisations and individuals came forward to press for the demand, which resulted in the Leh Apex Body (LAB) and Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA) coming together. Their representatives were in talks with a high-powered committee of the home ministry over four key demands -- Sixth Schedule, statehood, a separate public service commission and Lok Sabha seats in Leh and Kargil. Presently, the Union Territory of Ladakh has only one Lok Sabha constituency. ""During the talks with the home ministry, we felt they were buying time before the election. They did not have much to offer. Only some assurance was given on the public service commission,"" he said. He also dismissed reports that they were assured of extending Article 371-like protections to the region which would enable them to create elected bodies with the power to administrate tribal areas. ""The home ministry did not give any offer of Article 371. It was a speculation. They told us our existing councils will be strengthened and they will create an advisory council. We already have the LAHDC Act (Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council Act, 1997). But now the powers of the council have also been curtailed,"" he said. With a three-cornered fight between BJP's Tashi Gyalson, Congress' Tsering Namgyal and Independent candidate from Kargil Mohd Hanifa Jan being witnessed here, Lakruk said the Kargil candidate has an edge over his rivals. Both Gyalson and Namgyal are from Leh. ""Unfortunately in Ladakh the tradition is that voting is on a regional basis. So the independent candidate will have some edge. Votes in Kargil will get consolidated behind him. There are more chances for him to win,"" Lakruk said. He said they had anticipated that some regional and religious sentiments may come to the fore during elections, but it will not impact the unity of the two regions over their demands. ""We could see that at the time of election, some religious or regional sentiments may come in. Apex body and KDA have discussed this. Whatever the results of elections are, our unity on the four demands will not be affected,"" he said. He said the LBA went to every village and settlement to educate people on the demand for the Sixth Schedule. As the talks with the Union government failed, they were forced to take the path of protest. ""We resorted to hunger strike to show the government that all people in Ladakh are supporting the issue. We also wanted to tell the country what the problems of Ladakh are,"" he said. Asked about the Pashmina March which was announced but then withdrawn, he said the aim was to show the people of India the reality of the situation in Ladakh. ""The march was important because the lands of the nomadic people who are dependent on cattle are being taken away.

""Perhaps a lot of people in the country don't know how much land has gone and we wanted to show that. But the administration did not allow it... They did not allow us to go because they had something to hide. Nonetheless they were exposed,"" he said. Asked how much land he thinks may have been captured, he said, ""It is difficult to say.

The demands are valid within the ambit of the Constitution. We are not talking of 'azadi' (freedom), as some people in Jammu and Kashmir do."" He said if the aspirations of the Ladakhis are fulfilled, the country's defence will be strengthened. ""Because in an area like Ladakh, the civilians always stand behind the Army during war time...

However, this move contradicts the decision made by the Kargil Democratic Alliance , which has nominated Haji Haneefa Jan as its candidate. Under the seat-sharing agreement between the NC and Congress, the Ladakh seat was allocated to Congress, a decision that sparked dissent within the NC ranks. Furthermore, two independent candidates, Sajjad Hussain and Kacho Mohd Feroz, withdrew their nominations in support of Jan, paving the way for a triangular contest in the constituency where the BJP has fielded Tashi Gyalon, chief executive councillor-cum-chairman of the Ladakh Autonomous Civil Development Council (Leh). Haneefa Jan, backed by powerful religious institutions, emerges as a formidable contender in the electoral arena. The KDA, in tandem with the Leh Apex Body, has been at the forefront of a four-year-long agitation advocating for Ladakh's statehood, inclusion in the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, separate Lok Sabha seats for Leh and Kargil, and employment opportunities for local youths. Akhoon emphasized that their resignation from the NC was a sacrifice made in the greater interest of Ladakh, particularly the Kargil region, reaffirming their unwavering support for Jan's candidacy. He underscored Jan's status as the unanimous choice of all political, social, and religious factions in Kargil. ""Jan is the united choice of KDA and we thank both the independents who withdrew in his support. The party high command was putting pressure on us to support Congress party's official candidate. They were telephoning me and I told them 'never'. We made the sacrifice in the larger interest of Ladakh, especially Kargil,"" he said. Acknowledging the withdrawal of two independent candidates, the Returning Officer of the Ladakh Lok Sabha constituency, Santosh Sukhadeve, confirmed a three-way contest for the seat in the upcoming fifth phase of elections scheduled for May 20th. The Ladakh Lok Sabha constituency, renowned as the largest in the country in terms of geographical expanse, spanning over 173.266 square kilometers with a voter base exceeding 1.82 lakh, remains poised for a closely watched electoral battle.",Times of India,India

These parties secured a total of 2,030 votes, more than the victory margin. But this year, only three political parties are in the fray, apart from an independent; and these 2,000-odd votes could very well decide the winner. Faizal says that the voters in Lakshadweep are smart enough to choose the right candidate. “Lakshadweep has a small number of voters, and they are very familiar with the name and photo. Not having the clock sym bol wouldn’t matter much. BJP contested here in the last two elections, and it is not contesting this year, making it evident that NCP Ajit Pawar faction candidate is an NDA candidate. There is no situation prevailing on the islands that is favourable for BJP,” he says. Congress’s Hamdullah Sayeed (left) has lost back-to-back LS contests to Mohammed Faizal, who is in the fray this time as the NCP(SCP) candidate The last few years have been particularly tumultuous for the people of Lakshadweep with protests erupting over an array of administrative changes brought in by the Union Territory administration. From a draft bill proposing a beef ban in 2021 to a circular sparking fear of a hijab ban in educational institutions, the archipelago has been tense. Al though there was elation over a spike in tourism initiatives, it also raised ecological concerns and residents claimed that their lands were being taken over without proper compensation. Also, travel woes of islanders to the mainland remain a concern. The islanders still rely on air evacuation to Kochi in case of a serious medical emergency. While Faizal says that the is about who was at the forefront in the political resistance against the acts of administrator Praful Khoda Patel, Sayeed claims that all sectors in Lakshadweep are in a shambles. “Be it education, health, transport… every sector is in a pathetic condition now. The rate of unemployment is soaring. Creating jobs for youngsters would be a priority for us. The elected official is supposed to question the administration’s acts if it is not in favour of the people. The travel crisis that people face is due to lack of such constructive interventions. Change should come so that the people’s lives become easier,” says Sayeed. Last year, Faizal was disqualified twice as an MP over his conviction in a 2009 attempt to murder case. The case relates to the murder attempt on Mohammed Salih, a Congress worker and son-in-law of former Union minister PM Sayeed, on April 16, 2009, when Lok Sabha elections were un derway. He was first disqualified from Lok Sabha on Jan 13, 2023, two days after a sessions court sentenced him to 10 years in prison. On Jan 25, Kerala HC suspended his conviction and his sentence, following which he moved the Supreme Court against the disqualification. His membership was restored on March 29, but the SC, while hearing the case, found fault with the HC relief for Faizal and directed that the case be heard again. This led to the HC reversing its own order, and Faizal acquiring the unique distinction of being disqualified as Lok Sabha MP for the second time in under a year. SC, however, intervened again on Oct 9, and Faizal was reinstated to Lok Sabha in Nov last year. The Lok Sabha secretariat’s decision to reinstate Faizal was made after the SC suspended his conviction in the case. Meanwhile, NA Muhammed Kutty, NCP national general secretary and Lakshadweep in-charge, who is in the UT campaigning for Yousuf says their candidate is acceptable to everyone. “The candidate is that of NCP, and not that of NDA. Parties are contesting differently in different states. Both the other candidates in the fray have not done anything for the islands. Our candidate is a known scholar, and we believe that we will be able to secure votes from both Congress and the Sharad Pawar faction. The clock symbol would also work in our favour,” says Kutty.",Times of India,India

He also said the Union government has the right to dissolve the Lok Sabha and opt for early polls. “The party, which has a majority at the Centre, if wished, can hold the Lok Sabha polls prior to its actual time,” Nitish said. Responding to media queries at the Raj Bhavan after attending the swearing-in ceremony of his party MLA Ratnesh Sada as a cabinet minister, Nitish, who is scheduled to host a meeting of leading opposition parties from across the country in Patna on June 23, said, “We have taken initiatives for unity among the opposition parties. They (BJP leaders) might have a fear that the opposition leaders will make more movement in the coming months and it will cause more loss to them (BJP). …They might opt for the early Lok Sabha polls.” The JD(U) leader also said he was not sure, but there always remains a ‘strong possibility’ of holding early polls (when the ruling party holds majority in LS). “That is the reason I have asked the leaders of all opposition parties that you will win the (Lok Sabha) election only if all parties contest unitedly against BJP,” Nitish said. The Bihar CM also recalled how the (then) BJP leaders had preferred to hold the 2004 Lok Sabha polls three-four months earlier than its schedule, even though the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was not in its favour. Then, Nitish was a cabinet minister in the Vajpayee-led NDA government. BJP had lost the 2004 polls to the Congress-led UPA.

"Congress, BJP gun for one",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/lok-sabha-elections/puducherry/news/congress-bjp-gun-for-one-seat-in-puducherry/articleshow/108972984.cms,,"PUDUCHERRY: It is a battle of pride for Congress and BJP as the major national parties face each other for the first time in the Lok Sabha polls in Puducherry since the territory joined the Indian Union in 1962. And it looks like the two parties will leave no stone unturned to pocket the lone LS seat . The Congress comes in with an edge having won the last LS polls with candidate V Vaithilingam garnering 3.25 lakh votes to defeat Congress splinter group All India NR Congress (AINRC) candidate K Narayanasamy by more than 1.5 lakh votes. The party is fielding Vaithilingam again, confident he can pull off another victory. The BJP last contested Lok Sabha polls in Puducherry in 2009, its candidate M Visweswaran finishing fifth in the multi-cornered contest with just 13,442 votes in his kitty, also resulting in him losing his deposit. With three lakh votes, Congress candidate and former chief minister V Narayanasamy defeated PMK candidate M Ramadass by a little more than 91,000 votes. BJP is contesting in Puducherry after 15 years in a strong alliance led by AINRC. BJP also contested the 2004 Lok Sabha polls and its candidate Lalitha Kumaramangalam (1.72 lakh votes) lost to PMK candidate M Ramadoss (2.41 lakh votes), who contested in the Congress-led UPA. The Congress had then sacrificed its stronghold Puducherry to the PMK due to pressure from its allies. “The Puducherry Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) has no role in deciding on candidates,” says Vaithilingam, who is the PPCC president. “I will abide by decisions taken by the party high command. Our chance of winning the Puducherry seat with a massive margin is bright.” He says the party will seek votes listing out the failures of the AINRC govt. “That includes increasing incidence of crime against women and children and highlighting how Puducherry has turned into a hub for drug trafficking,” says Vaithilingam, citing the recent case of the sexual assault and murder of a nine-year-old girl. The Congress may try to focus on the poor policies of the AINRC-BJP coalition govt which led to a deteriorating law and order situation, the mushrooming of pubs and resto bars inviting other kinds of drugs into the territory. But on the other hand, infighting within the Congress might jeopardise its goal of retaining the seat. “The party has never given a young candidate a seat or considered the opinion of a senior leader, which led to many popular leaders quitting the party. Infighting within the party will have a say in this poll,” says a political observer. “We will also talk about how the BJP is dividing people along religion and caste lines. Look at the way BJP leaders campaign. They threaten people that if they don’t vote for the party, they will suffer,” says Vaithilingam. Meanwhile, the Puducherry BJP unit, buoyed by recent alliance dynamics — especially the fact that it convinced alliance leader AINRC to part with the Puducherry seat — is busy selecting its candidate. Poll in-charge Nirmal Kumar Surana says the party has shortlisted five candidates and is waiting for the high command’s go-ahead. Sources say the saffron party is trying to convince home minister A Namassivayam to contest, but he is not keen. Union finance minister Nirmala Sitaraman and lieutenant governor Tamilisai Soundararajan are the other prospective candidates. “We have a good chance of winning the seat and opening our account here,” says Surana. He adds that the party will highlight the achievements of the Union and Puducherry govts. “The Centre has executed several schemes benefitting all sections of people in Puducherry. Our Prime Minister is popular with the masses. The state govt too has performed exceptionally well.” Public works minister and AINRC leader K Lakshminarayan says the party has no regrets in sacrificing the seat to the BJP. “The idea is to get more benefits for the Union territory and an MP from Puducherry representing a national party can bring in more funds. BJP is set to bag more than 400 seats in the polls and our MP, and our territory will get the much-required prominence in Parliament.” Lakshminarayan says they are confident of winning the Puducherry seat. “The Centre sanctioned `2,600 crore loans to different sections of people at one go, which was unprecedented. The Congress govt could not present a full-fledged budget but the AINRC-BJP coalition govt presented a full-fledged budget after 10 years.” BJP’s alliance with the AINRC, which has the maximum number of MLAs (10 in a 30-member assembly) in the territory, should help garner more votes than in earlier previous polls. The party is also confident that most of the Centre’s schemes benefitted all sections, which would reflect in the voting pattern of the people. But, say political analysts, BJP’s inability to find a prospective local candidate might hamper its winning prospects. In that case, Rangasamy might select his party functionary to contest on the BJP ticket. “Moreover, the BJP’s stand of not considering the long pending demand of statehood status for Puducherry will be reflected in this poll. All major parties barring BJP included the statehood demand in their manifesto last time,” says the analyst. Meanwhile, the Puducherry AIADMK unit is keen on contesting the seat after the Dravidian party snapped ties with the BJP in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry making this a multi-cornered fight. Seeman’s NTK too has announced its candidate. Word is, AAP may enter the ring. AIADMK secretary A Anbalagan says more than 20 functionaries had submitted applications to the party high command expressing willingness to contest from the Puducherry parliamentary constituency and an official announcement will be made soon. “The BJP which released the first list of 195 candidates contesting did not announce one from Puducherry. We can understand the delay in announcing a candidate in Tamil Nadu as the party has not finalised its alliance, but in Puducherry, it has become clear the BJP will contest after Rangasamy’s announcement. The BJP could not finalise a candidate for the Puducherry seat as it is apprehensive about facing the polls without AIADMK support,” says Anbalagan.",Times of India,India

Banerjee alleged that the exit polls were prepared two months ago and conducted by a purportedly biased agency with ties to BJP. Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav echoed Banerjee's sentiments, labelling the exit polls as a tool of ""pro-BJP media"" designed to manipulate public perception. He suggested that the exit polls, which he said were prepared months in advance, could pave the way for fraudulent practices. ""Based on this exit poll, BJP wants to benefit from the share market which opens Monday. If these exit polls were not false and BJP was not losing, then BJP would not have blamed its own people.

DMK spokesperson TKS Elangovan dismissed predictions of BJP victories in the state and its neighbouring regions, asserting that INDIA bloc would sweep all 39 constituencies in Tamil Nadu. Elangovan said exit polls suggesting a surge in seats for BJP in Karnataka, Telangana and Kerala is flawed. ""In Karnataka, only recently Congress defeated BJP in assembly polls. In Telangana, Congress formed govt by defeating BRS,'' he said. In Bihar, exit polls conducted by different agencies have shown varying results, with LJP (RV) of Chirag Paswan projected to win ""4-6"" seats and CPM ""2-3"" seats in Jharkhand. RJD criticised the discrepancies, particularly noting the projection of LJP (RV) winning more seats than the five it contested. In Maharashtra, pollsters projected that BJP, despite aligning with CM Eknath Shinde's Shiv Sena and Ajit Pawar's NCP, will not hit the 41 tally it won in 2019. Sena minister Deepak Kesarkar expressed confidence in his party's performance, despite the challenges of last-minute candidate announcements.

&lsquo;Festival of democracy&rsquo;
BJP chief JP Nadda on Saturday said the people have voted for a capable, powerful, developed and self-reliant India and to put aside appeasement, nepotism and corruption.
Nadda exuded confidence that his party will win more than 370 Lok Sabha seats and the NDA more than 400.
In a statement, Nadda thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for making this &ldquo;festival of democracy&rdquo; a success for the BJP.
“In this election campaign, Prime Minister Modi addressed more than 206 election rallies, did about 23 roadshows, gave about 82 interviews and made tireless efforts to convey the election issues to the people of the country. His efforts are definitely yielding results,” the BJP chief said.
Meanwhile, the leaders of several INDI alliance parties met on Saturday to take stock of the Opposition&rsquo;s preparations leading up to the June 4 counting of votes polled in the Lok Sabha elections.
They claimed they will get more than 295 seats – enough to form the next government.
Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge asserted the INDI alliance has arrived at the figure after feedback from people.
“The INDI alliance will get more than 295 seats. We have arrived at this figure after speaking with all our leaders,” Kharge told reporters. “This is a survey of people. People have given this information to our leaders. The government surveys are there and their media friends also inflate figures and put it out. Therefore, we want to tell you about the reality.”
Targeting the BJP, Kharge said, “They are trying to give a narrative through government exit polls and we want to tell the people the truth.”
Meanwhile, the INDI alliance parties also announced they will participate in the exit poll debates on TV this evening after the
grouping&rsquo;s top leaders met and deliberated on the issue.
The development came a day after the Congress said it has decided not to participate in any Lok Sabha exit poll debates on television channels. The party does not want to indulge in speculation and slugfest for TRP, it had said.
“After considering factors for and against participating in the exit polls, it has been decided by consensus that all the INDIA (bloc) parties will participate in the exit poll debates on television this evening,” Congress&rsquo; media and publicity department head Pawan Khera said in a post on X.

The Opposition will likely need to undergo a fresh bout of introspection if the predictions bear out on 4 June.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi waves to his supporters . Reuters If the numbers hold, they would have failed at stymieing the juggernaut that is the NDA, despite combining their forces.
The question that needs to be asked – where do they go from here?

The government surveys are there and their media friends also inflate figures and put it out. Therefore, we want to tell you about the reality,&rdquo; he said.
BJP president J P Nadda, however, asserted that people have voted for a capable, powerful, developed and self-reliant India and to put aside appeasement, nepotism and corruption, exuding confidence that his party will win more than 370 Lok Sabha seats and the NDA over 400.
The counting of votes will take place on 4 June.

Here&rsquo;s what the News18 exit poll has predicted for the NDA and the INDI Alliance in some of the big states,"The voting for the Lok Sabha elections has come to an end and it’s been a lengthy process — seven long phases spread over six weeks. Now, it’s time to shift attention to the results. Before the results are announced on 4 June, here’s what the exit polls reveal.
Most exit polls are predicting a return of the Narendra Modi-led NDA government, winning over 350 seats, with the Opposition’s INDI Alliance managing somewhere between 125 and 150. News18 conducted its own mega exit poll, according to which NDA has bagged 355-370 seats, while the INDI Alliance has won 125-140 seats.
Advertisement But how has the NDA fared against the INDI Alliance in each state? We break through the clutter and present the results of the News18 mega exit poll in quick, easy graphics.
NORTH
The NDA, as per News18&rsquo;s exit poll, will continue its dominance in the north. In Uttar Pradesh, the NDA is poised to win 68-71 of the 80 seats, while the INDI Alliance is predicted to win nine-12 seats.
In Bihar, the NDA, of which Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s JDU is a part, will be bagging 31-34 seats, while INDI Alliance is believed to get six-nine seats. Delhi and Haryana is all about the NDA once again.
SOUTH
In the South, it seems a Narendra Modi-led push has helped the BJP. Exit polls predict an improved performance of the BJP in the five southern states. It seems in Andhra Pradesh, the alliance with Chandrababu Naidu-led Telugu Desam Party has paid big dividends for the BJP, with the NDA emerging on top. In Telangana, the News18 exit poll gives BJP a big reason to smile, predicting the party to win seven-10 seats, compared to Congress’ five-eight.
Karnataka is also expected to vote overwhelmingly for the BJP, despite its preference for the Congress at the state level. In Tamil Nadu, the party is even expected to make a debut, securing between one-three seats, exit polls predict.

Another big surprise is from the state of Odisha. The exit poll has predicted a clean sweep for the BJP. The poll predicts the BJP will win 13-15 seats, with the BJD to come in second with six-eight seats.

In the West, the BJP-led NDA is predicted to be the big winner as per the exit poll. Gujarat is the big news here with the NDA set to be sweeping all 26 seats. Meanwhile, in Maharashtra, the NDA is predicted to win 32-35 seats, with the INDI Alliance winning 15-18 seats.
In Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, it&rsquo;s all about the NDA once again. The News18 exit poll predicts 26-29 seats for the NDA out of the 29 seats. In Rajasthan, the NDA is predicted to win 18-25 seats.

Now, with the counting of votes scheduled for 4 June, all eyes are on the exit polls. The exit polls have been released at 6.30 pm.
This is in line with the Section 126A of the Representation of the People’s Act, 1951, which states that exit polls can only be aired half an hour after the completion of the final phase of voting.
Advertisement But what did they predict in 2014 and 2019? And how accurate are exit polls really?
Let’s take a closer look:
2014
Going into 2014, pollsters were under some pressure.
After all, the exit polls had failed to get it right in back-to-back Lok Sabha elections.
In 2004, the polls predicated that the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA, which was relying on the ‘India shining’ campaign, would win big.
However, the Congress made a huge comeback in 2004.
In 2009, the exit polls predicted the UPA would get the most seats, but that the result would be a hung Parliament.
The Congress-led coalition defied the odds yet again with the Grand Old Party itself getting 200 seats.
In 2014, all the exit polls favoured the BJP-led NDA under Narendra Modi.
For NDA
The News24-Chanakya poll predicted that the NDA would nab 340 seats, while the India Today-Cicero poll gave the coalition 272 seats. The CNN-IBN-CSDS said the alliance would win 280 seats, while the Times Now poll gave the NDA.
The ABP News-Nielsen predicted 274 seats for the NDA, while the NDTV-Hansa Research estimated 279 seats for the NDA.
For UPA
For the UPA, the India Today-Cicero pollster predicted 115 seats, while News 24-Chanakya estimated 101 seats. The CNN-IBN-CSDS gave the alliance 97 seats, while Times Now projected 148 seats.
Advertisement The ABP News-Nielsen said the UPA would win 97 seats, while NDTV-Hansa Research said the alliance would net 103 seats.
Pollsters seemed to underestimate the hunger for change in the public mind as well as the sheer scale of the NDA’s victory and the UPA’s defeat.
Of all the pollsters, the News24-Chanakya was most on the money.
Advertisement The NDA would go on to win a massive 336 seats with the BJP itself crossing the half-way mark in Parliament and netting 282 seats.
The UPA, on the other hand, would be reduced to just 60 seats with the Congress winning 44 seats by its lonesome.
2019 polls
In 2019, most pollsters predicted that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA government would return – albeit with a reduced margin.
For NDA
The India Today-Axis pollster predicted that the NDA would win between 339 and 365 seats, while the News 24-Today’s Chanakya gave the alliance 350 seats.
The News18-IPSOS poll said the NDA would net 336 seats, while Times Now-VMR predicted 306 seats for the NDA.
The India TV-CNX pollster estimated 300 seats for the alliance, while the Sudarshan News poll gave the NDA 305 seats.
Advertisement For UPA
Meanwhile, for the UPA, the India Today-Axi poll predicted between 77 and 108 seats, while the News 24-Today’s Chanakya estimated 95 seats.
The News18-IPSOS poll said the UPA would win 82 seats, while the Times Now-VMR poll gave the alliance 132 seats.
The India TV-CNX predicted 120 seats for the UPA, while Sudarshan News estimated the alliance would net 124 seats.
The India Today-Axis gave the UPA between 77 and 108 seats, while News 24-Today’s Chanakya predicted 95 seats.
Most of the pollsters yet again failed to gauge the popularity of the BJP-led NDA.
Advertisement The NDA, incredibly, ended up bettering its 2014 tally in a resounding vote of confidence in Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The alliance won 352 seats with the BJP itself winning 303 seats.
Meanwhile, the Congress-led UPA expanded its tally to 91 seats with the grand old party winning 52 seats – but it was nothing to write home about.
The News 24-Today’s Chanakya was yet again the most accurate pollster.
Are exit polls accurate?
Not necessarily.
As noted above, pollsters have been off the mark with remarkable frequency in at least four recent Lok Sabha elections including 2004 and 2009.
Exit polls are also often condemned for being biased, relying on skewed data or improper sample size, and being sponsored or politically motivated, Business Standard.
The Economic Times quoted TK Arun as saying, “Exit polls are tricky in India. Indians are prudent people. Why would they tell a pollster anything other than what they figure out the pollster wants to hear? Suppose he voted Congress, and says so to the pollster, the BJP wins the election and extracts from pollsters details of all those who said they voted Congress, what mayhem might not follow? Why take the risk? Indians can be rational when the issue at stake is lack of faith as well.”
In short, exit polls can be hazardous to a political junkie’s health.

Lok Sabha Election 2024: How are exit polls conducted and are they accurate?,https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-are-exit-polls-conducted-how-accurate-are-exit-polls-lok-sabha-elections-2024-exit-polls-general-elections-13777162.html,"The largest democratic exercise in the world, India&rsquo;s 18th Lok Sabha Elections, concludes today. Following the 44-day electoral process, exit polls will commence, providing predictions on the likely victors and the extent of their triumph. What are these polls? Do they always get it right?","India&rsquo;s 18th Lok Sabha Elections, the largest democratic exercise on the planet, will conclude on 1 June, 2024 as the seventh phase comes to a close . As the lengthy 44-day electoral process ends, attention will shift to exit polls, which are expected to provide insights into the election outcomes starting from 6:30 pm on 1 June.
Exit polls are crucial for gauging the mood of the electorate and predicting the likely winners before the official results are declared. However, their accuracy and methodology are often subjects of debate and scrutiny.
Advertisement What is the methodology behind exit polls?
Exit polls are conducted by surveying voters immediately after they cast their votes. This method contrasts with opinion polls, which are conducted before the elections to gather voters&rsquo; views on various issues and candidates. Exit polls aim to provide a snapshot of voting trends, influenced by various factors such as issues, personalities, and party loyalties.
The methodology of exit polls involves interviewing voters outside polling stations using a structured questionnaire. This approach relies on the voters&rsquo; recent experiences, increasing the likelihood of obtaining accurate responses.

AP The data collected is then analysed to estimate vote shares and predict seat outcomes. These polls are typically conducted by private firms or media organisations rather than government agencies.
How has technology changed conducting exit polls?
Technological advancements have significantly influenced the conduct of exit polls. Techniques such as call-backs to respondents, images of interviews being conducted, phone calls from the field, and WhatsApp groups have enhanced data collection and analysis.
Despite these advancements, ensuring the accuracy of predictions remains challenging due to the complex and diverse nature of the Indian electorate.

AP Structured questionnaires are vital for coherent data collection and systematic analysis, reported Indian Express. The Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) emphasises the importance of representative samples in ensuring accurate predictions. A large sample size is crucial, but the representativeness of the sample is equally important.
Advertisement What challenges are faced while conducting exit polls?
Estimating vote shares and predicting seat outcomes are the primary challenges in conducting exit polls. The swing model, which relies on past election results, is influenced by various factors such as geographic location, caste, religion, and economic class.
Changes in political alliances between elections can also affect predictions. The prediction process is labour-intensive and time-consuming, as it involves making estimates for each seat.

AP The complexity of swings increases with the number of political players. For example, the BJP and JD(U) alliance in Bihar poses a challenge for the swing model. Over- or under-representation of diverse voter sections can impact the accuracy of estimates.
Advertisement How accurate are exit polls?
The accuracy of exit polls depends on various factors beyond sample size. The representativeness of the sample, the methodology used, and the ability to account for diverse voter profiles are critical. Some agencies rely on innovative methods, such as eliminating certain constituencies from the poll, to improve accuracy.
Also Read: Predictions, predilections, and Indian general elections For instance, the Lokniti-CSDS uses post-poll surveys with large sample sizes but echoes the need for representative samples. Their predictions have varied in accuracy, highlighting the complexities involved in electoral predictions.
Have exit polls ever got it wrong?
Historically, exit polls have had mixed accuracy. Some notable instances where exit polls diverged significantly from actual results include:
Advertisement 2004 Lok Sabha Elections: Exit polls predicted a majority for the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA government. However, the actual results saw the NDA falling short of expectations.
Delhi Assembly Elections 2015: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) secured a sweeping victory with 67 out of 70 seats, which was underestimated by exit polls.
Bihar Assembly Elections 2015: Exit polls predicted a close race, but the RJD-JDU-Congress coalition won decisively.
UP Assembly Elections 2017: Despite exit polls predicting a hung assembly, the BJP won over 300 seats.
2014 Lok Sabha Elections: Exit polls did not foresee the BJP achieving an outright majority, which it did by crossing the 272-mark on its own.
In India, exit polls are regulated under Section 126A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. This section prohibits the conduct and publication of exit polls during the polling period to avoid influencing voters.

Why are exit polls released after all votes are cast? Why are they relevant?,https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-are-exit-polls-released-after-all-votes-are-cast-why-are-they-relevant-13776094.html,Exit polls are essentially quick interviews with voters.

The seventh and final phase of the Lok Sabha polls is underway with 57 parliamentary constituencies set to cast their vote across eight states and union territories.

But what do we know about exit polls? What is their history? Why are they relevant? And what about their rules?

What are they?
Exit polls are essentially quick interviews with voters.
They are usually conducted right after voters exit the polls on voting day – as opposed to opinion polls which are conducted beforehand.
The idea behind them is to offer a snapshot of the voters’ concerns. They are aimed at predicting which party is likely to come to power.
Several news channels and agencies in India conduct exit polls – with varying degrees of success.
As per Business Standard, their accuracy depends on a slew of factors including structured questionnaires, in-person or telephonic interviews of random people for fairness, sample size, demographic representation, data compilation, and count method.
The first exit poll was conducted in 1957 by the Indian Institute of Public Opinion.
The group conducted an exit poll during the second Lok Sabha elections.
As per Hindustan Times, it was the Delhi-based Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) that pioneered in the 1960s.
But it was another two decades before exit polls began being taken seriously in the media.
This is when psephologist Prannoy Roy teamed up with David Butler.
Advertisement Roy, Butler and Ashok Lahiri would go on to publish a landmark book The Compendium of Indian Elections.
State-run Doordarshan asking the CSDS to conduct a countrywide exit poll in 1996 also brought exit polls further into the mainstream.
“Without a structured questionnaire, the data can neither be collected coherently nor be analysed systematically to arrive at vote share estimates,” Indian Express quoted Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) director Sanjay Kumar as saying.
What are the rules for exit polls?
Exit polls are governed by The Representation of People Act, 1951.
Section 126 A of the act restricts publication and dissemination of exit polls results.
Advertisement Exit polls are usually conducted right after voters exit the polls on voting day – as opposed to opinion polls which are conducted beforehand. PTI It states, “No person shall conduct any exit poll and publish or publicise by means of the print or electronic media or disseminate in any other manner, whatsoever, the result of any exit poll during such period, as may be notified by the Election Commission in this regard.”
It adds that in case of a general election, the period may commence from the beginning of the hours fixed for the poll on the first day and continue till half an hour after the closing of the poll in all the States and Union territories.
According to Business Standard, this is done so that exit polls don’t influence voters or voting patterns.
Advertisement Those who violate this provision can be sentenced to a prison term of up to two years, a fine or both.
The Election Commission first issued guidelines on exit polls in 1998. The EC under Article 324 of the Constitution barred newspapers and television news channels from publishing or broadcasting results of opinion and exit polls between 5 pm on 14 February 1998 and 5 pm on 7 March 1998. The first phase in that year’s general elections began on 16 February 1998, and the final phase began on 7 March.
As per Economic Times, the EC in 2022 said news broadcasters must not air any final, formal and definite results &ldquo;until such results are formally announced by the Election Commission of India, unless such results are carried with clear disclaimer that they are unofficial or incomplete or partial results or projections which should not be taken as final results.&rdquo;
Advertisement Why are exit polls relevant?
Because people want to know which party and candidates are likely to win &ndash; and quickly.
However, critics say that they are often left wanting when it comes to accuracy.
According to Business Standard, exit polls are also often condemned for being biased, relying on skewed data or improper sample size, and being sponsored or politically motivated. The Economic Times quoted TK Arun as saying, &ldquo;Exit polls are tricky in India. Indians are prudent people. Why would they tell a pollster anything other than what they figure out the pollster wants to hear? Suppose he voted Congress, and says so to the pollster, the BJP wins the election and extracts from pollsters details of all those who said they voted Congress, what mayhem might not follow? Why take the risk? Indians can be rational when the issue at stake is lack of faith as well.&rdquo;
In the past, exit polls have had both hits and misses galore.
According to Hindustan Times, except for the 1998 and 2014 polls, at least four Lok Sabha polls have gotten it badly wrong.
This includes two back-to-back predictions in 2004 and 2009.
The 2004 exit polls in particular were a massive failure with the pollsters completely missing the Congress coming back to power as the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA with its ‘India Shining’ slogan lost its majority.
All exit polls predicted a win for the BJP.
Again in 2009, while most pollsters gave the edge to the UPA, they completely missed a huge swing in its favour.
The UPA added 40 more seats to its tally.
A man looks at a television screen showing exit poll results after the last phase of the general election in Ahmedabad on 19 May 2019. File photo/Reuters In 2014, the BJP won over 330 seats.
While most pollsters said then prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi and the BJP-led NDA would cross the 272 mark, almost none of them forecast the decisive performance.
It was only pollster Chanakya, who predicted 340 seats for the NDA, that came close to getting it spot on.
In 2019, most pollsters predicted that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA government would return &ndash; albeit with a reduced margin compared to the previous election. Of course, we know that the pollsters yet again underestimated the strength of the BJP-led NDA, which would nab 353 seats.

"Predictions, predilections, and Indian general elections",https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/predictions-predilections-and-indian-general-elections-13775669.html,Election predictions are notoriously hard due to the changing nature of the parameters,"Predictions are awfully difficult, even with the reassuring crunch of numbers! And yet, they are our fatal predilection, whether the challenge is for our pleasure or for that of others. Be it the stock market, astrology, or gambling, our insatiable curiosity for the mysterious and unknown is probably what propels such abandonment.
Take the ongoing Lok Sabha polls, going on for perhaps too long now, and the concomitant barrage of prophecies from TV channels, from YouTube “influenczars” and from downright bored individuals, all of whom shoot off their incendiary numbers into the tinder of social media. These soothsayers speak from relative ignorance and mostly from a fascination for a particular party, be they pidis or bhakts.They speak with the confidence that they can actually fool all the people all the time, with Abraham Lincoln being the ultimate fool, poor man. What is most horrendous is that all of them have declared random numbers like 180, 200, 250, 272, 303, 320, 362, 370, and the ace of spades, 400, long before all the votes have come in. This is why I liken election predictions in India to gambling. It is matka guessing in a satta bazar. Parrot talk, or tarot talk, it leads to no concrete outcome. It does not affect the choices made by the voters, choices one suspects were cast in stone, long before the elections were even announced. And yet, these delirious djinns persist, as their minds are made up too. The happy side to this sad fantasy is that it is time-bound, and we can all reclaim our normal lives on June 4.
Advertisement Lighter comments aside, there is a more serious side to prediction, based on the assumption that future events are influenced to some or a greater extent by what has happened before. History is our greatest teacher. The art and science of good prediction lie in identifying which past (or present) event will likely influence an event to come. Let us take the Indian monsoon, an annual event of major economic importance to our nation, and one that has just begun this year. It would help the government enormously if it knew a few months in advance if the monsoon were to be normal, below average, or will punch above its weight.
At present, the Indian monsoon is predicted using a combination of atmospheric models, sea surface temperature analysis, historical data, and satellite observations. Key factors include the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, the Indian Ocean Dipole, and wind patterns. Advanced computational models simulate these variables to forecast rainfall and monsoon onset accurately. However, there are totally different methods of monsoon prediction that would not be considered ‘scientific’ by western definition, but are yet chillingly accurate. Traditionally, some Indian communities predict the monsoon by observing the nesting behaviour of certain birds, like the Indian weaver bird (Baya Weaver). It is believed that if these birds build their nests on higher branches, a heavier monsoon will ensue. Conversely, lower nests indicate lighter rainfall. This method relies on the birds&rsquo; instinctive response to environmental cues, and seems to be largely reliable. Nature lovers might like to correlate this occurrence with the Japanese kō or 72 micro-seasons, for further poetic justification.
Advertisement Prediction is a key aspect of science, and the smaller the number of known events, phenomena, and parameters used to predict a large number of future events accurately, the better the value of the prediction. At the risk of introducing an equation in this column, one can say the value of a prediction, V = (N/n) – 1, where one is able to correctly predict N outcomes with n parameters. According to this equation, the value of a prediction is zero if one needs n parameters to predict N outcomes.
Let’s apply this equation to the present Lok Sabha election. We could say that N = 543, in other words, we want to correctly predict the results from 543 constituencies. How many parameters would we need, or what is the value of n, for a good prediction? What our present-day pollsters are doing, in trying to improve the accuracy of their guesses, is to increase the number of parameters to absurd levels. They ask whether all the Muslim women in Kishanganj will vote like their menfolk, whether the hot summer days in Ramagundam will harm voting, or whether all the Gounders in Kovai will stay loyal to the AIADMK. The problem with such micro-parameters is that they cannot be quantified properly. Informal surveys on the ground may not be the answer because all respondents may not answer truthfully. We see ludicrous statements from politicians—some say that low turnouts hurt the BJP, while others say that low turnouts hurt the Congress. Others say that a low or high turnout may help or hurt a party, depending on the state. Still others say that whatever happens, Congress is winning. The problem with any or all of this is that none of it can be either proven or disproven—this makes it non-scientific. The reader will appreciate that as n increases with all these unprovable parameters, the value of the prediction quickly goes to zero. It is easier to say that there is only one parameter in this election, and that is the prime minister himself. Applying the equation, the value of my prediction is (543/1) – 1 = 542, which in practical terms means a sizable majority for the BJP. I think I’m doing pretty well for myself with this prediction. June 4 will tell.
Advertisement What I would have liked to see, and what seems missing, is a more accurate assessment of ‘swing’ constituencies in bellwether states. No expert needs to predict that the BJP will win in Gandhinagar or that it will lose in South Kolkata. On the other hand, if the BJP were to win in Thiruvananthapuram, Bengaluru Rural, Hyderabad, or Central Chennai, this would signify that winds of change are blowing across the country. The very high voter turnout in Baramulla is another pointer. An ability to extrapolate from this to an accurate prediction about the Kashmir Valley in particular and the country in general, is what is missing. Once again, what I would like to see on June 4 is how soon any particular TV channel is able to call the election, say by 9, 10, or 11 am? The sooner it is able to do this, the better its reports will be and the less fluff and bluff.
Advertisement Election predictions are notoriously hard due to the changing nature of the parameters, something we do not usually see in science. The Truman-Dewey US presidential election of 1945, was made memorable by the photograph of the victor, Harry Truman, brandishing a copy of the Chicago Tribune that screamed the wrong headline, “Dewey defeats Truman”. So close was the vote. At the end of World War II, the UK voted against Winston Churchill, their doughty PM, who had saved them from Nazi tyranny. He was hustled out of office when the Labour Party won by a substantial majority. Can we ever imagine a similar situation in India? And yet, some of our own elections have indeed yielded surprising results, and one recollects 1971, 1977, and 2019, when the decisiveness of the mandate was quite something else.
Advertisement So, let’s take all these prognostications in stride and await the authentic verdict.

Beyond the Lines | Indian elections: What the biggest show on earth can teach the world,https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/beyond-the-lines-indian-elections-what-the-biggest-show-on-earth-can-teach-the-world-13773225.html,"Not only are the Indian general elections the largest poll show on earth — they are also the most intensely contested and certainly, sets the bar for America to follow this November","This was going to be the global election year that decides the fate of the world. This was also going to be the biggest election in the world’s biggest democracy. With over 900 million broadband subscribers, the Indian voter is more plugged into the commentary of the voting analysis, trends and outcomes.
The cacophony of election analysis is hardwired into the heads of Indian citizens through their phones and devices, their choices dictated by opinions and beliefs, which in turn has been an outcome of results seen in the last five years. Yet, when I went to cast my vote this Monday, the booth-level machinery was so well-oiled and efficient that beyond the cacophony of election sloganeering and digital pyrotechnics, the unassuming power of silent citizens dutifully stepping up to vote on their appointed day, sans drama or hyperbole, held up a useful guide for the rest of the world to emulate.
Advertisement India, the world’s most populous democracy, is currently holding its general election over a seven-phase period that continues for seven weeks. Indians can vote between 19 April and 1 June, with the results set to be declared on 4 June.
The World Decides in 2024
Over fifty elections take place in 2024, including some of the most impacting ones such as the US, Russia, India, Taiwan. Fifty-one per cent of the world will either have a new dispensation or continue with the existing one. As elections take place across the world, the festival of democracy in India is expected to be among the keenly contested, fair and well organised ones in the world.
These elections have also proved that India sets consistent standards in choosing their leaders, disproving a biased opinion about democracy and elections that certain western thinking has held towards India. Using a template of a fairness score to evaluate the independence of elections in countries, as a well-known western publication recently did, reduces the process of choices in elections to a rating number which can both end up being biased and patronising, and is dictated by a long-held expectation that Indian polls are simultaneously cantankerous and exotic — a work in progress democracy that promises to be civilised but is never one. It also served to quietly aid a narrative that the democratic processes in the west are superior.
Advertisement Why India’s Free Elections Trumps West’s Bias
Take for instance, the freedom and fairness score accorded to India’s elections, which is 0.53 and compare it to the other nations in their leadup to the elections. Mexico is a country heading for elections this year. In this election cycle, 30 candidates have already been assassinated, according to data from the research firm Laboratorio Electoral. In 2021, 30 candidates were killed while in 2018, the elections saw 24 killings. These elections are expected to be among the most violent. According to western pundits, Mexico has a freedom and fairness score of 0.75 in the conduct of elections, which indicates the elections are more ‘just and fair’ than in India. Parts of western media has been unduly harsh on India, rating its fairness score of elections at 0.53.
Advertisement In Indonesia, the electoral process is still dominated by corrupt or influential leaders who grew powerful during the authoritarian rule of Suharto. Democracy is new, and power oscillated between influential stakeholders, till Joko Widodo, an outsider, broke the stranglehold. Thereafter, a general took over as President — one the west has accused of human rights abuses. Interestingly, Indonesia’s freedom and fairness score stands at 0.68, higher than India. Which means that the credibility of Indian elections is just about better than the banana republics — an assumption that betrays the negative bias of such studies.
The US, rated high in freedom and fairness index by the publication, struggled under serious allegations of tampering and influence by Russia and the subsequent response of Trump supporters laying siege in Washington DC after losing the elections indicated a democracy that was functional but not civilised. On the other hand, far from the history of some of the nations, who have either embraced dysfunctional democracy along the way or seem to be falling by the wayside in terms of their law and order situation in the lead up to the elections, India has maintained an enviable record of holding free and fair elections over seven decades.
Advertisement The Decisive Indian Vote
From the general election held in 1951-52 in which 17.5 crore Indians, voted in the elections to the 18th Lok Sabha that are under way, the process has evolved and matured along with Indian democracy over the decades. So have the voters graduated, from being largely illiterate to being well informed and technically savvy while making choices.
The CEC explained why the voluntary nature of casting votes means that the ECI operates ‘in an entirely persuasive space, inviting the citizens to volunteer to become part of the electoral roll and, thereafter, through systematic voter awareness programmes, motivates them to exercise their franchise.’ There is a high elector to population ratio which underpins the discipline, patience and belief that Indian voters have demonstrated in executing the process. The power of Indian elections demonstrates a growing, emerging India that is willing and ready to show how democracy is a proven political system in this world. Take for instance the example of Jammu and Kashmir.
Advertisement Since 1989, all earlier elections in the region had been plagued by violence and a tendence towards anarchy, influenced by separatist parties. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Anantnag, Srinagar and Baramulla — the Lok Sabha seats — recorded dismal attendance.
Baramulla recorded 46 per cent voting in 1996. Thereafter it has struggled to have voters on election days. Twenty-eight years later, 59 per cent of Baramulla showed up to vote on polling day, breaking the previous record.
This time, local political leaders have addressed large crowds who are keen to be a part of the time-tested process of democracy and express their opinions at the poll booths, unlike earlier times when boycotts dominated Kashmiri elections and the turnout, cowed down by the gun, often struggled to crawl out of single digit percentage attendance.
The resolve to bring Kashmir out of a rut of decades-old militancy by taking the gun out of the equation has helped locals trust the power of the ballot in making lives better instead of being ruled by fear of militancy. There is a growing curiosity about the choices available in a democracy through the power of the ballot, which many people in the state now see value in, unlike across the border where democracy is in shambles and offers no choices.
Younger India: 18 Million First-Time Voters
One of the key aspects in these elections is the addition of over 2-crore young first time voters. These voters, in each successive edition, are going to boost a voting population that consumes digital information and has a strong sense of independent opinion. A keen interest among young voters has led to parties canvassing through digital platforms. An increasingly politically conscious, intelligent but less patient voter base has meant that parties have had to address more matured issues – which also tells us how India has travelled a fair distance from the days when Garibi Hatao was a dominating slogan.
The voter turnout, lower in the early stages, yet reflects an involved participation of its citizens across the country. In a country where different belief systems have held sway, the one common space where India comes together as a country is its general election. Which is why, an election season resembles a festival of choices rather than a mere mechanical process of choosing.
India Votes for the World to Emulate
In the previous national edition in 2019, the Election Commission confirmed a 67 per cent turnout. The Americans were marginally higher in the same period while voting in their elections. The Indian elections have also been among the most expensive elections, in which political parties spent more than 7 billion in 2019, higher than the spends in the US elections in that period. Not only are the Indian general elections the largest poll show on earth — they are also the most intensely contested and certainly, sets the bar for America to follow this November.
While wars and conflicts singe the world in most parts and certain nations have gone berserk losing their way while making choices, India proves yet again that this election festival of citizens is not only the biggest but also the most civilised and sane process on earth.

"Busy dousing fire on Swati Maliwal 'assault' row, AAP loses a week of Kejriwal's freedom and fought against itself than rivals",https://www.firstpost.com/india/busy-dousing-fire-on-swati-maliwal-assault-row-aap-loses-a-week-of-kejriwals-freedom-and-fought-against-itself-than-rivals-13772369.html,"Amid the escalating blame game, the focus abruptly moved from Arvind Kejriwal to Swati Maliwal and the internal feud between Maliwal and other AAP members overshadowed Kejriwal&rsquo;s continuous attacks on the prime minister and the BJP","When the Supreme Court granted interim bail to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on 10 May until 2 June, the AAP leader had a clear agenda ahead. Arrested on 21 March by the Enforcement Directorate in the liquor policy case, Kejriwal now had 21 days to capitalise on his temporary release. His primary focus would have been to generate publicity for himself and the AAP by intensifying his criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP.
Advertisement The Maliwal incident: A shift in focus
This situation progressed smoothly until the Swati Maliwal incident on 13 May. On that day, AAP Rajya Sabha MP Swati Maliwal accused Bibhav Kumar, a member of Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal&rsquo;s personal staff of misconduct. Following her allegations, the Delhi Police arrested Kejriwal&rsquo;s private assistant Bibhav Kumar, igniting a dual conflict: AAP versus BJP and Swati Maliwal versus the rest of AAP.
Amid the escalating blame game, two significant shifts occurred. First, the focus abruptly moved from Arvind Kejriwal to Swati Maliwal. Second, the internal feud between Maliwal and other AAP members overshadowed Kejriwal&rsquo;s continuous attacks on the prime minister and the BJP.
Significantly, this incident consumed a crucial portion of Kejriwal&rsquo;s 21 days of freedom with an entire week diverted to the Maliwal controversy.
Strategic reorientation
Regardless of whether AAP inadvertently fell into a trap or recognised the situation belatedly, Kejriwal understood the pressing need to redirect attention back to himself. He needed to refocus the battle onto BJP territory and distance the party from the Maliwal incident. Whether it was genuine support for his long-time aide Kumar or a strategy to revitalise AAP, the Delhi chief minister knew that a significant move was necessary to reclaim the spotlight.
What better way to do it than challenge Prime Minister Modi to arrest all AAP leaders as he announced on Saturday that he would march to BJP headquarters in Delhi on Sunday at noon accompanied by all the prominent leaders of his party. More the chaos better the publicity.
Advertisement Kejriwal alleged that the BJP was trying to completely destroy AAP through Operation Jhadu. He shared that people who were familiar with both the BJP and him had informed him that Prime Minister Modi acknowledged AAP&rsquo;s growing influence and the global discussion around their work. Kejriwal said that the BJP saw AAP as a potential tough challenger in several states and wanted to eliminate them. He made these statements while addressing the press at the party office on Sunday.
Importance of Delhi for AAP
Voting for all seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi is scheduled for 25 May as part of Phase 6 of the polling.
Advertisement Delhi is of paramount importance to the AAP for several reasons. It is the party&rsquo;s primary base and stronghold where it was founded and first achieved significant political success by winning the Delhi Legislative Assembly elections in 2013. Maintaining control over Delhi is essential for AAP&rsquo;s political legitimacy and influence. Furthermore, Delhi serves as a showcase for AAP&rsquo;s governance model and policies.
AAP finds itself grappling with the challenge of maintaining a focussed engagement with its diverse electorate in Delhi, which encompasses various socioeconomic groups. Amid its efforts to highlight flagship programmes such as mohalla clinics, subsidised electricity and its work in government schools, the controversy surrounding Maliwal has diverted public attention from these areas which AAP would have wanted to bring in front of the voters.
Advertisement Whether the Maliwal incident is indeed a premeditated attack on AAP as the party alleges or simply a coincidence only time will reveal. However, there is no doubt that it has placed AAP in a defensive position precisely when it was gearing up for a strong offensive. Whether it&rsquo;s a calculated move by a political mastermind or just an unfortunate stroke of fate remains uncertain for now.

How Swati Maliwal row is disrupting Arvind Kejriwal’s campaign for Lok Sabha polls,https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/swati-maliwal-row-arvind-kejriwal-13772041.html,"While Arvind Kejriwal&rsquo;s release from jail to campaign for the Lok Sabha polls came as a big relief to the AAP and the Opposition, the Swati Maliwal controversy has cast a pall over proceedings. While the Delhi chief minister has remained mum over the matter, the party has claimed that there is a &lsquo;BJP conspiracy&rsquo; to frame him","Arvind Kejriwal must have felt great relief when he was granted bail by the Supreme Court.
The apex court granted the Delhi chief minister bail in the alleged money laundering case in order to campaign for the Lok Sabha polls.
But the controversy over Swati Maliwal has dogged Kejriwal at every step.
Maliwal, the AAP&rsquo;s Rajya Sabha MP, filed an FIR on Thursday accusing the Delhi chief minister&rsquo;s aide Bibhav Kumar of assaulting her. Advertisement The AAP has alleged a conspiracy is being hatched against Kejriwal, while the BJP has demanded stringent action against the accused.
Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at how the row has disrupted his campaign:
Kejriwal&rsquo;s release from jail was a big boost to the party and the Opposition.
The Times of India quoted Sandeep Pathak, a close aide of Kejriwal who is overseeing the AAP Lok Sabha campaign, as saying the development breathed fresh life into the party.
&ldquo;With him, the cadre feels happier, much more positive, much more charged. That’s one aspect of it. The other is that the BJP thought that they would get Kejriwal arrested and then start breaking up the AAP in Delhi and Punjab. But they miserably failed,&rdquo; the AAP Rajya Sabha MP said.
But Maliwal&rsquo;s accusations have now cast a pall over proceedings.
&ldquo;While the whole truth is not out yet, all is certainly not well inside the AAP. There have been reports of differences between Kejriwal and Maliwal for some time. There are claims that Kejriwal was not happy with Maliwal&rsquo;s absence from Delhi before and after his arrest as well as her relative silence on his arrest. Maliwal, however, was reportedly visiting her sister in the US,&rdquo; the piece stated.
It noted that if Kejriwal is sent to jail again for a long time, the party is likely to fracture. But if he is granted regular bail, he will likely be able to keep his team together.
&ldquo;What was supposed to be a few weeks of respite for Kejriwal are proving to be a testing period. His attention will now be divided between the election campaign and the party affairs,&rdquo; the piece noted.
Advertisement On Wednesday some people also raised slogans during Kejriwal&rsquo;s road show in Chandni Chowk against Kumar, as per The Times of India.
&lsquo;Slapped, hit in stomach&rsquo;
Maliwal in her FIR filed Thursday claimed she was &ldquo;slapped, hit in the stomach and kicked&rdquo; by Kumar.
The FIR was registered after Maliwal&rsquo;s statement was recorded by a two-member team led by Additional Commissioner of Police P.S. Kushwaha.
The team was at Maliwal&rsquo;s residence in central Delhi for nearly four and a half hours.
AAP Rajya Sabha MP Swati Maliwal has accused Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal&rsquo;s aide of assault. PTI File Photo Maliwal claimed she ran out of the CM&rsquo;s residence and called the police immediately after the incident.
Kejriwal was present at his residence when the incident took place, she added.
Advertisement Maliwal broke down several times while giving the statement and sought strict action against Kumar.
The AAP MP on Thursday underwent medical check-up at All India Institute of Medical Sciences.
Kejriwal evades question, BJP attacks
Adding fuel to the fire, Kejriwal on Wednesday did not address Maliwal&rsquo;s allegations during a press conference.
Kejriwal, flanked by Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav and AAP Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh, evaded a question on the subject.
Singh, however, said his party has already made its stand clear on the issue.

&mdash; ANI (@ANI) May 16, 2024 Advertisement Singh, who had met Maliwal at her residence on Wednesday, said, &ldquo;The AAP is our family. Party has made its view clear.&rdquo;
He also targeted the BJP government at the Centre by raising the issue of a Manipuri woman being paraded naked, the Prajwal Revanna sex scandal and Maliwal being &ldquo;beaten up&rdquo; by police during protests by wrestlers when she was the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) chief.
Advertisement &ldquo;I want that BJP and PM should also answer on the issues I have kept before you. He (PM) should answer on the issue of Swati Maliwal, who was dragged and beaten when she went to seek justice for the female wrestlers. I just want to say don&rsquo;t play political games on the issues,&rdquo; he said.
Yadav then took the microphone and said &ldquo;there are more important things than that&rdquo;.
Then, unfolding a piece of paper, he added, &ldquo;BJP people are not with anyone, it is a &lsquo;gang&rsquo; that lodges false cases&rdquo;.
Singh at a press conference on Tuesday had accepted that Kumar had &ldquo;misbehaved&rdquo; with Maliwal.
He also labelled the incident &lsquo;highly condemnable&rsquo;, as per The Times of India.
BJP national spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia claimed that Kejriwal is the main &ldquo;criminal&rdquo; in the complaint that his aide Kumar had physically attacked Maliwal at the chief minister&rsquo;s residence, as he cited the telephone call she had made to the Delhi Police to report the matter.
&ldquo;His (Kejriwal) silence speaks a lot. Out of jail, he is more a &lsquo;goonda&rsquo; than a chief minister,&rdquo; he told reporters, noting that Kumar was seen with the chief minister in Lucknow.
Stringent action should be taken against the accused in the case, he said.
Kumar, he noted, was photographed with Kejriwal during his visit to Lucknow.
On Friday, the Delhi BJP Mahila Morcha members staged a protest near Kejriwal&rsquo;s residence.
Led by Mahila Morcha president Richa Pandey Mishra, the protesters, who were carrying bangles, demanded Kejriwal&rsquo;s resignation.
Mishra said the Mahila Morcha wanted to hand over the bangles to Kejriwal for keeping mum over the incident with Maliwal that occurred at his official residence.
“Arvind Kejriwal should be ashamed. He should resign from his post and apologise to the country. Swati Maliwal should get justice,&quot; a Mahila Morcha member told PTI.
The Mahila Morcha of the Delhi BJP also extended support to Maliwal, writing a letter to her saying the incident was a matter of honour of women in the country.
A team of the Delhi Police also turned up at Kejriwal&rsquo;s residence on Friday, as per India Today.
&lsquo;BJP conspiracy to frame Kejirwal&rsquo;
Meanwhile, the AAP has claimed the case is a &lsquo;BJP conspiracy to frame Kejriwal.&rsquo;
Senior AAP leader Atishi at a press conference said, &ldquo;Today a video has surfaced that has exposed the lie of Maliwal. In her FIR, she has said she was brutally assaulted and she was in pain, and buttons of her shirt were torn. A video that has surfaced shows an entirely different reality.&rdquo;
Atishi said the video shows Maliwal &ldquo;comfortably sitting in the drawing room&rdquo; and &ldquo;threatening the security staff&rdquo;, and that &ldquo;her clothes were not torn&rdquo;.
&ldquo;The video shows her threatening Kumar. The charges levelled by Maliwal are baseless. Maliwal insisted on meeting Kejriwal. She is Rajya Sabha MP and she should know that the CM has a busy schedule. Kumar told her that the chief minister is busy and unable to meet her. She shouted at him, pushed him and tried to enter the residential portion of the CM House,&rdquo; she claimed.
&ldquo;The whole incident proves that it was a BJP conspiracy and Swati Maliwal was made its face to frame Kejriwal,&rdquo; she alleged.
Asked about Singh accepting misbehaviour with Maliwal, Atishi said, &ldquo;AAP MP Sanjay Singh met Maliwal and he had only her version. But now this video has brought out the truth.&rdquo;

In Graphics | What News18 exit poll predicts about your state in Lok Sabha election 2024,https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/lok-sabha-elections-news18-exit-poll-state-wise-results-nda-indi-alliance-in-graphics-13777629.html,The voting in the Lok Sabha elections is over and exit polls are out. Here&rsquo;s what the News18 exit poll has predicted for the NDA and the INDI Alliance in some of the big states,"The voting for the Lok Sabha elections has come to an end and it’s been a lengthy process — seven long phases spread over six weeks. Now, it’s time to shift attention to the results. Before the results are announced on 4 June, here’s what the exit polls reveal.
Most exit polls are predicting a return of the Narendra Modi-led NDA government, winning over 350 seats, with the Opposition’s INDI Alliance managing somewhere between 125 and 150. News18 conducted its own mega exit poll, according to which NDA has bagged 355-370 seats, while the INDI Alliance has won 125-140 seats.
Advertisement But how has the NDA fared against the INDI Alliance in each state? We break through the clutter and present the results of the News18 mega exit poll in quick, easy graphics.
NORTH
The NDA, as per News18&rsquo;s exit poll, will continue its dominance in the north. In Uttar Pradesh, the NDA is poised to win 68-71 of the 80 seats, while the INDI Alliance is predicted to win nine-12 seats.
In Bihar, the NDA, of which Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s JDU is a part, will be bagging 31-34 seats, while INDI Alliance is believed to get six-nine seats. Delhi and Haryana is all about the NDA once again.
SOUTH
In the South, it seems a Narendra Modi-led push has helped the BJP. Exit polls predict an improved performance of the BJP in the five southern states. It seems in Andhra Pradesh, the alliance with Chandrababu Naidu-led Telugu Desam Party has paid big dividends for the BJP, with the NDA emerging on top. In Telangana, the News18 exit poll gives BJP a big reason to smile, predicting the party to win seven-10 seats, compared to Congress’ five-eight.
Karnataka is also expected to vote overwhelmingly for the BJP, despite its preference for the Congress at the state level. In Tamil Nadu, the party is even expected to make a debut, securing between one-three seats, exit polls predict.

But how did they fare in 2014 and 2019? Which pollster got it right and which missed the mark?","Voting for the seventh and final phase of the Lok Sabha polls concluded today.
Now, with the counting of votes scheduled for 4 June, all eyes are on the exit polls. The exit polls have been released at 6.30 pm.
This is in line with the Section 126A of the Representation of the People’s Act, 1951, which states that exit polls can only be aired half an hour after the completion of the final phase of voting.
Advertisement But what did they predict in 2014 and 2019? And how accurate are exit polls really?
Let’s take a closer look:
2014
Going into 2014, pollsters were under some pressure.
After all, the exit polls had failed to get it right in back-to-back Lok Sabha elections.
In 2004, the polls predicated that the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA, which was relying on the ‘India shining’ campaign, would win big.
However, the Congress made a huge comeback in 2004.
In 2009, the exit polls predicted the UPA would get the most seats, but that the result would be a hung Parliament.
The Congress-led coalition defied the odds yet again with the Grand Old Party itself getting 200 seats.
In 2014, all the exit polls favoured the BJP-led NDA under Narendra Modi.
For NDA
The News24-Chanakya poll predicted that the NDA would nab 340 seats, while the India Today-Cicero poll gave the coalition 272 seats. The CNN-IBN-CSDS said the alliance would win 280 seats, while the Times Now poll gave the NDA.
The ABP News-Nielsen predicted 274 seats for the NDA, while the NDTV-Hansa Research estimated 279 seats for the NDA.
For UPA
For the UPA, the India Today-Cicero pollster predicted 115 seats, while News 24-Chanakya estimated 101 seats. The CNN-IBN-CSDS gave the alliance 97 seats, while Times Now projected 148 seats.
Advertisement The ABP News-Nielsen said the UPA would win 97 seats, while NDTV-Hansa Research said the alliance would net 103 seats.
Pollsters seemed to underestimate the hunger for change in the public mind as well as the sheer scale of the NDA’s victory and the UPA’s defeat.
Of all the pollsters, the News24-Chanakya was most on the money.
Advertisement The NDA would go on to win a massive 336 seats with the BJP itself crossing the half-way mark in Parliament and netting 282 seats.
The UPA, on the other hand, would be reduced to just 60 seats with the Congress winning 44 seats by its lonesome.
2019 polls
In 2019, most pollsters predicted that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA government would return – albeit with a reduced margin.
For NDA
The India Today-Axis pollster predicted that the NDA would win between 339 and 365 seats, while the News 24-Today’s Chanakya gave the alliance 350 seats.
The News18-IPSOS poll said the NDA would net 336 seats, while Times Now-VMR predicted 306 seats for the NDA.
The India TV-CNX pollster estimated 300 seats for the alliance, while the Sudarshan News poll gave the NDA 305 seats.
Advertisement For UPA
Meanwhile, for the UPA, the India Today-Axi poll predicted between 77 and 108 seats, while the News 24-Today’s Chanakya estimated 95 seats.
The News18-IPSOS poll said the UPA would win 82 seats, while the Times Now-VMR poll gave the alliance 132 seats.
The India TV-CNX predicted 120 seats for the UPA, while Sudarshan News estimated the alliance would net 124 seats.
The India Today-Axis gave the UPA between 77 and 108 seats, while News 24-Today’s Chanakya predicted 95 seats.
Most of the pollsters yet again failed to gauge the popularity of the BJP-led NDA.
Advertisement The NDA, incredibly, ended up bettering its 2014 tally in a resounding vote of confidence in Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The alliance won 352 seats with the BJP itself winning 303 seats.
Meanwhile, the Congress-led UPA expanded its tally to 91 seats with the grand old party winning 52 seats – but it was nothing to write home about.
The News 24-Today’s Chanakya was yet again the most accurate pollster.
Are exit polls accurate?
Not necessarily.
As noted above, pollsters have been off the mark with remarkable frequency in at least four recent Lok Sabha elections including 2004 and 2009.
Exit polls are also often condemned for being biased, relying on skewed data or improper sample size, and being sponsored or politically motivated, Business Standard.
The Economic Times quoted TK Arun as saying, “Exit polls are tricky in India. Indians are prudent people. Why would they tell a pollster anything other than what they figure out the pollster wants to hear? Suppose he voted Congress, and says so to the pollster, the BJP wins the election and extracts from pollsters details of all those who said they voted Congress, what mayhem might not follow? Why take the risk? Indians can be rational when the issue at stake is lack of faith as well.”
In short, exit polls can be hazardous to a political junkie’s health.

Following the 44-day electoral process, exit polls will commence, providing predictions on the likely victors and the extent of their triumph. What are these polls? Do they always get it right?","India&rsquo;s 18th Lok Sabha Elections, the largest democratic exercise on the planet, will conclude on 1 June, 2024 as the seventh phase comes to a close . As the lengthy 44-day electoral process ends, attention will shift to exit polls, which are expected to provide insights into the election outcomes starting from 6:30 pm on 1 June.
Exit polls are crucial for gauging the mood of the electorate and predicting the likely winners before the official results are declared. However, their accuracy and methodology are often subjects of debate and scrutiny.
Advertisement What is the methodology behind exit polls?
Exit polls are conducted by surveying voters immediately after they cast their votes. This method contrasts with opinion polls, which are conducted before the elections to gather voters&rsquo; views on various issues and candidates. Exit polls aim to provide a snapshot of voting trends, influenced by various factors such as issues, personalities, and party loyalties.
The methodology of exit polls involves interviewing voters outside polling stations using a structured questionnaire. This approach relies on the voters&rsquo; recent experiences, increasing the likelihood of obtaining accurate responses.

AP The data collected is then analysed to estimate vote shares and predict seat outcomes. These polls are typically conducted by private firms or media organisations rather than government agencies.
How has technology changed conducting exit polls?
Technological advancements have significantly influenced the conduct of exit polls. Techniques such as call-backs to respondents, images of interviews being conducted, phone calls from the field, and WhatsApp groups have enhanced data collection and analysis.
Despite these advancements, ensuring the accuracy of predictions remains challenging due to the complex and diverse nature of the Indian electorate.

AP Structured questionnaires are vital for coherent data collection and systematic analysis, reported Indian Express. The Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) emphasises the importance of representative samples in ensuring accurate predictions. A large sample size is crucial, but the representativeness of the sample is equally important.
Advertisement What challenges are faced while conducting exit polls?
Estimating vote shares and predicting seat outcomes are the primary challenges in conducting exit polls. The swing model, which relies on past election results, is influenced by various factors such as geographic location, caste, religion, and economic class.
Changes in political alliances between elections can also affect predictions. The prediction process is labour-intensive and time-consuming, as it involves making estimates for each seat.

AP The complexity of swings increases with the number of political players. For example, the BJP and JD(U) alliance in Bihar poses a challenge for the swing model. Over- or under-representation of diverse voter sections can impact the accuracy of estimates.
Advertisement How accurate are exit polls?
The accuracy of exit polls depends on various factors beyond sample size. The representativeness of the sample, the methodology used, and the ability to account for diverse voter profiles are critical. Some agencies rely on innovative methods, such as eliminating certain constituencies from the poll, to improve accuracy.
Also Read: Predictions, predilections, and Indian general elections For instance, the Lokniti-CSDS uses post-poll surveys with large sample sizes but echoes the need for representative samples. Their predictions have varied in accuracy, highlighting the complexities involved in electoral predictions.
Have exit polls ever got it wrong?
Historically, exit polls have had mixed accuracy. Some notable instances where exit polls diverged significantly from actual results include:
Advertisement 2004 Lok Sabha Elections: Exit polls predicted a majority for the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA government. However, the actual results saw the NDA falling short of expectations.
Delhi Assembly Elections 2015: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) secured a sweeping victory with 67 out of 70 seats, which was underestimated by exit polls.
Bihar Assembly Elections 2015: Exit polls predicted a close race, but the RJD-JDU-Congress coalition won decisively.
UP Assembly Elections 2017: Despite exit polls predicting a hung assembly, the BJP won over 300 seats.
2014 Lok Sabha Elections: Exit polls did not foresee the BJP achieving an outright majority, which it did by crossing the 272-mark on its own.
In India, exit polls are regulated under Section 126A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. This section prohibits the conduct and publication of exit polls during the polling period to avoid influencing voters.

Why are exit polls released after all votes are cast? Why are they relevant?,https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-are-exit-polls-released-after-all-votes-are-cast-why-are-they-relevant-13776094.html,Exit polls are essentially quick interviews with voters.

The seventh and final phase of the Lok Sabha polls is underway with 57 parliamentary constituencies set to cast their vote across eight states and union territories.

But what do we know about exit polls? What is their history? Why are they relevant? And what about their rules?

What are they?
Exit polls are essentially quick interviews with voters.
They are usually conducted right after voters exit the polls on voting day – as opposed to opinion polls which are conducted beforehand.
The idea behind them is to offer a snapshot of the voters’ concerns. They are aimed at predicting which party is likely to come to power.
Several news channels and agencies in India conduct exit polls – with varying degrees of success.
As per Business Standard, their accuracy depends on a slew of factors including structured questionnaires, in-person or telephonic interviews of random people for fairness, sample size, demographic representation, data compilation, and count method.
The first exit poll was conducted in 1957 by the Indian Institute of Public Opinion.
The group conducted an exit poll during the second Lok Sabha elections.
As per Hindustan Times, it was the Delhi-based Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) that pioneered in the 1960s.
But it was another two decades before exit polls began being taken seriously in the media.
This is when psephologist Prannoy Roy teamed up with David Butler.
Advertisement Roy, Butler and Ashok Lahiri would go on to publish a landmark book The Compendium of Indian Elections.
State-run Doordarshan asking the CSDS to conduct a countrywide exit poll in 1996 also brought exit polls further into the mainstream.
“Without a structured questionnaire, the data can neither be collected coherently nor be analysed systematically to arrive at vote share estimates,” Indian Express quoted Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) director Sanjay Kumar as saying.
What are the rules for exit polls?
Exit polls are governed by The Representation of People Act, 1951.
Section 126 A of the act restricts publication and dissemination of exit polls results.
Advertisement Exit polls are usually conducted right after voters exit the polls on voting day – as opposed to opinion polls which are conducted beforehand. PTI It states, “No person shall conduct any exit poll and publish or publicise by means of the print or electronic media or disseminate in any other manner, whatsoever, the result of any exit poll during such period, as may be notified by the Election Commission in this regard.”
It adds that in case of a general election, the period may commence from the beginning of the hours fixed for the poll on the first day and continue till half an hour after the closing of the poll in all the States and Union territories.
According to Business Standard, this is done so that exit polls don’t influence voters or voting patterns.
Advertisement Those who violate this provision can be sentenced to a prison term of up to two years, a fine or both.
The Election Commission first issued guidelines on exit polls in 1998. The EC under Article 324 of the Constitution barred newspapers and television news channels from publishing or broadcasting results of opinion and exit polls between 5 pm on 14 February 1998 and 5 pm on 7 March 1998. The first phase in that year’s general elections began on 16 February 1998, and the final phase began on 7 March.
As per Economic Times, the EC in 2022 said news broadcasters must not air any final, formal and definite results &ldquo;until such results are formally announced by the Election Commission of India, unless such results are carried with clear disclaimer that they are unofficial or incomplete or partial results or projections which should not be taken as final results.&rdquo;
Advertisement Why are exit polls relevant?
Because people want to know which party and candidates are likely to win &ndash; and quickly.
However, critics say that they are often left wanting when it comes to accuracy.
According to Business Standard, exit polls are also often condemned for being biased, relying on skewed data or improper sample size, and being sponsored or politically motivated. The Economic Times quoted TK Arun as saying, &ldquo;Exit polls are tricky in India. Indians are prudent people. Why would they tell a pollster anything other than what they figure out the pollster wants to hear? Suppose he voted Congress, and says so to the pollster, the BJP wins the election and extracts from pollsters details of all those who said they voted Congress, what mayhem might not follow? Why take the risk? Indians can be rational when the issue at stake is lack of faith as well.&rdquo;
In the past, exit polls have had both hits and misses galore.
According to Hindustan Times, except for the 1998 and 2014 polls, at least four Lok Sabha polls have gotten it badly wrong.
This includes two back-to-back predictions in 2004 and 2009.
The 2004 exit polls in particular were a massive failure with the pollsters completely missing the Congress coming back to power as the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA with its ‘India Shining’ slogan lost its majority.
All exit polls predicted a win for the BJP.
Again in 2009, while most pollsters gave the edge to the UPA, they completely missed a huge swing in its favour.
The UPA added 40 more seats to its tally.
A man looks at a television screen showing exit poll results after the last phase of the general election in Ahmedabad on 19 May 2019. File photo/Reuters In 2014, the BJP won over 330 seats.
While most pollsters said then prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi and the BJP-led NDA would cross the 272 mark, almost none of them forecast the decisive performance.
It was only pollster Chanakya, who predicted 340 seats for the NDA, that came close to getting it spot on.
In 2019, most pollsters predicted that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA government would return &ndash; albeit with a reduced margin compared to the previous election. Of course, we know that the pollsters yet again underestimated the strength of the BJP-led NDA, which would nab 353 seats.

"Predictions, predilections, and Indian general elections",https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/predictions-predilections-and-indian-general-elections-13775669.html,Election predictions are notoriously hard due to the changing nature of the parameters,"Predictions are awfully difficult, even with the reassuring crunch of numbers! And yet, they are our fatal predilection, whether the challenge is for our pleasure or for that of others. Be it the stock market, astrology, or gambling, our insatiable curiosity for the mysterious and unknown is probably what propels such abandonment.
Take the ongoing Lok Sabha polls, going on for perhaps too long now, and the concomitant barrage of prophecies from TV channels, from YouTube “influenczars” and from downright bored individuals, all of whom shoot off their incendiary numbers into the tinder of social media. These soothsayers speak from relative ignorance and mostly from a fascination for a particular party, be they pidis or bhakts.They speak with the confidence that they can actually fool all the people all the time, with Abraham Lincoln being the ultimate fool, poor man. What is most horrendous is that all of them have declared random numbers like 180, 200, 250, 272, 303, 320, 362, 370, and the ace of spades, 400, long before all the votes have come in. This is why I liken election predictions in India to gambling. It is matka guessing in a satta bazar. Parrot talk, or tarot talk, it leads to no concrete outcome. It does not affect the choices made by the voters, choices one suspects were cast in stone, long before the elections were even announced. And yet, these delirious djinns persist, as their minds are made up too. The happy side to this sad fantasy is that it is time-bound, and we can all reclaim our normal lives on June 4.
Advertisement Lighter comments aside, there is a more serious side to prediction, based on the assumption that future events are influenced to some or a greater extent by what has happened before. History is our greatest teacher. The art and science of good prediction lie in identifying which past (or present) event will likely influence an event to come. Let us take the Indian monsoon, an annual event of major economic importance to our nation, and one that has just begun this year. It would help the government enormously if it knew a few months in advance if the monsoon were to be normal, below average, or will punch above its weight.
At present, the Indian monsoon is predicted using a combination of atmospheric models, sea surface temperature analysis, historical data, and satellite observations. Key factors include the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, the Indian Ocean Dipole, and wind patterns. Advanced computational models simulate these variables to forecast rainfall and monsoon onset accurately. However, there are totally different methods of monsoon prediction that would not be considered ‘scientific’ by western definition, but are yet chillingly accurate. Traditionally, some Indian communities predict the monsoon by observing the nesting behaviour of certain birds, like the Indian weaver bird (Baya Weaver). It is believed that if these birds build their nests on higher branches, a heavier monsoon will ensue. Conversely, lower nests indicate lighter rainfall. This method relies on the birds&rsquo; instinctive response to environmental cues, and seems to be largely reliable. Nature lovers might like to correlate this occurrence with the Japanese kō or 72 micro-seasons, for further poetic justification.
Advertisement Prediction is a key aspect of science, and the smaller the number of known events, phenomena, and parameters used to predict a large number of future events accurately, the better the value of the prediction. At the risk of introducing an equation in this column, one can say the value of a prediction, V = (N/n) – 1, where one is able to correctly predict N outcomes with n parameters. According to this equation, the value of a prediction is zero if one needs n parameters to predict N outcomes.
Let’s apply this equation to the present Lok Sabha election. We could say that N = 543, in other words, we want to correctly predict the results from 543 constituencies. How many parameters would we need, or what is the value of n, for a good prediction? What our present-day pollsters are doing, in trying to improve the accuracy of their guesses, is to increase the number of parameters to absurd levels. They ask whether all the Muslim women in Kishanganj will vote like their menfolk, whether the hot summer days in Ramagundam will harm voting, or whether all the Gounders in Kovai will stay loyal to the AIADMK. The problem with such micro-parameters is that they cannot be quantified properly. Informal surveys on the ground may not be the answer because all respondents may not answer truthfully. We see ludicrous statements from politicians—some say that low turnouts hurt the BJP, while others say that low turnouts hurt the Congress. Others say that a low or high turnout may help or hurt a party, depending on the state. Still others say that whatever happens, Congress is winning. The problem with any or all of this is that none of it can be either proven or disproven—this makes it non-scientific. The reader will appreciate that as n increases with all these unprovable parameters, the value of the prediction quickly goes to zero. It is easier to say that there is only one parameter in this election, and that is the prime minister himself. Applying the equation, the value of my prediction is (543/1) – 1 = 542, which in practical terms means a sizable majority for the BJP. I think I’m doing pretty well for myself with this prediction. June 4 will tell.
Advertisement What I would have liked to see, and what seems missing, is a more accurate assessment of ‘swing’ constituencies in bellwether states. No expert needs to predict that the BJP will win in Gandhinagar or that it will lose in South Kolkata. On the other hand, if the BJP were to win in Thiruvananthapuram, Bengaluru Rural, Hyderabad, or Central Chennai, this would signify that winds of change are blowing across the country. The very high voter turnout in Baramulla is another pointer. An ability to extrapolate from this to an accurate prediction about the Kashmir Valley in particular and the country in general, is what is missing. Once again, what I would like to see on June 4 is how soon any particular TV channel is able to call the election, say by 9, 10, or 11 am? The sooner it is able to do this, the better its reports will be and the less fluff and bluff.
Advertisement Election predictions are notoriously hard due to the changing nature of the parameters, something we do not usually see in science. The Truman-Dewey US presidential election of 1945, was made memorable by the photograph of the victor, Harry Truman, brandishing a copy of the Chicago Tribune that screamed the wrong headline, “Dewey defeats Truman”. So close was the vote. At the end of World War II, the UK voted against Winston Churchill, their doughty PM, who had saved them from Nazi tyranny. He was hustled out of office when the Labour Party won by a substantial majority. Can we ever imagine a similar situation in India? And yet, some of our own elections have indeed yielded surprising results, and one recollects 1971, 1977, and 2019, when the decisiveness of the mandate was quite something else.

Lok Sabha elections 2024: How many candidates have criminal cases against them?,https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/lok-sabha-elections-2024-how-many-candidates-have-criminal-cases-against-them-13774183.html,"A comprehensive analysis of the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) shows that 1,644 of the 8,337 candidates contesting in the ongoing Lok Sabha elections have criminal cases registered against them, including allegations of murder, attempted murder, crimes against women, and hate speech","The Lok Sabha election in India is nearing its conclusion.

Beyond the Lines | Indian elections: What the biggest show on earth can teach the world,https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/beyond-the-lines-indian-elections-what-the-biggest-show-on-earth-can-teach-the-world-13773225.html,"Not only are the Indian general elections the largest poll show on earth — they are also the most intensely contested and certainly, sets the bar for America to follow this November","This was going to be the global election year that decides the fate of the world. This was also going to be the biggest election in the world’s biggest democracy. With over 900 million broadband subscribers, the Indian voter is more plugged into the commentary of the voting analysis, trends and outcomes.
The cacophony of election analysis is hardwired into the heads of Indian citizens through their phones and devices, their choices dictated by opinions and beliefs, which in turn has been an outcome of results seen in the last five years. Yet, when I went to cast my vote this Monday, the booth-level machinery was so well-oiled and efficient that beyond the cacophony of election sloganeering and digital pyrotechnics, the unassuming power of silent citizens dutifully stepping up to vote on their appointed day, sans drama or hyperbole, held up a useful guide for the rest of the world to emulate.
Advertisement India, the world’s most populous democracy, is currently holding its general election over a seven-phase period that continues for seven weeks. Indians can vote between 19 April and 1 June, with the results set to be declared on 4 June.
The World Decides in 2024
Over fifty elections take place in 2024, including some of the most impacting ones such as the US, Russia, India, Taiwan. Fifty-one per cent of the world will either have a new dispensation or continue with the existing one. As elections take place across the world, the festival of democracy in India is expected to be among the keenly contested, fair and well organised ones in the world.
These elections have also proved that India sets consistent standards in choosing their leaders, disproving a biased opinion about democracy and elections that certain western thinking has held towards India. Using a template of a fairness score to evaluate the independence of elections in countries, as a well-known western publication recently did, reduces the process of choices in elections to a rating number which can both end up being biased and patronising, and is dictated by a long-held expectation that Indian polls are simultaneously cantankerous and exotic — a work in progress democracy that promises to be civilised but is never one. It also served to quietly aid a narrative that the democratic processes in the west are superior.
Advertisement Why India’s Free Elections Trumps West’s Bias
Take for instance, the freedom and fairness score accorded to India’s elections, which is 0.53 and compare it to the other nations in their leadup to the elections. Mexico is a country heading for elections this year. In this election cycle, 30 candidates have already been assassinated, according to data from the research firm Laboratorio Electoral. In 2021, 30 candidates were killed while in 2018, the elections saw 24 killings. These elections are expected to be among the most violent. According to western pundits, Mexico has a freedom and fairness score of 0.75 in the conduct of elections, which indicates the elections are more ‘just and fair’ than in India. Parts of western media has been unduly harsh on India, rating its fairness score of elections at 0.53.
Advertisement In Indonesia, the electoral process is still dominated by corrupt or influential leaders who grew powerful during the authoritarian rule of Suharto. Democracy is new, and power oscillated between influential stakeholders, till Joko Widodo, an outsider, broke the stranglehold. Thereafter, a general took over as President — one the west has accused of human rights abuses. Interestingly, Indonesia’s freedom and fairness score stands at 0.68, higher than India. Which means that the credibility of Indian elections is just about better than the banana republics — an assumption that betrays the negative bias of such studies.
The US, rated high in freedom and fairness index by the publication, struggled under serious allegations of tampering and influence by Russia and the subsequent response of Trump supporters laying siege in Washington DC after losing the elections indicated a democracy that was functional but not civilised. On the other hand, far from the history of some of the nations, who have either embraced dysfunctional democracy along the way or seem to be falling by the wayside in terms of their law and order situation in the lead up to the elections, India has maintained an enviable record of holding free and fair elections over seven decades.
Advertisement The Decisive Indian Vote
From the general election held in 1951-52 in which 17.5 crore Indians, voted in the elections to the 18th Lok Sabha that are under way, the process has evolved and matured along with Indian democracy over the decades. So have the voters graduated, from being largely illiterate to being well informed and technically savvy while making choices.
The CEC explained why the voluntary nature of casting votes means that the ECI operates ‘in an entirely persuasive space, inviting the citizens to volunteer to become part of the electoral roll and, thereafter, through systematic voter awareness programmes, motivates them to exercise their franchise.’ There is a high elector to population ratio which underpins the discipline, patience and belief that Indian voters have demonstrated in executing the process. The power of Indian elections demonstrates a growing, emerging India that is willing and ready to show how democracy is a proven political system in this world. Take for instance the example of Jammu and Kashmir.
Advertisement Since 1989, all earlier elections in the region had been plagued by violence and a tendence towards anarchy, influenced by separatist parties. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Anantnag, Srinagar and Baramulla — the Lok Sabha seats — recorded dismal attendance.
Baramulla recorded 46 per cent voting in 1996. Thereafter it has struggled to have voters on election days. Twenty-eight years later, 59 per cent of Baramulla showed up to vote on polling day, breaking the previous record.
This time, local political leaders have addressed large crowds who are keen to be a part of the time-tested process of democracy and express their opinions at the poll booths, unlike earlier times when boycotts dominated Kashmiri elections and the turnout, cowed down by the gun, often struggled to crawl out of single digit percentage attendance.
The resolve to bring Kashmir out of a rut of decades-old militancy by taking the gun out of the equation has helped locals trust the power of the ballot in making lives better instead of being ruled by fear of militancy. There is a growing curiosity about the choices available in a democracy through the power of the ballot, which many people in the state now see value in, unlike across the border where democracy is in shambles and offers no choices.
Younger India: 18 Million First-Time Voters
One of the key aspects in these elections is the addition of over 2-crore young first time voters. These voters, in each successive edition, are going to boost a voting population that consumes digital information and has a strong sense of independent opinion. A keen interest among young voters has led to parties canvassing through digital platforms. An increasingly politically conscious, intelligent but less patient voter base has meant that parties have had to address more matured issues – which also tells us how India has travelled a fair distance from the days when Garibi Hatao was a dominating slogan.
The voter turnout, lower in the early stages, yet reflects an involved participation of its citizens across the country. In a country where different belief systems have held sway, the one common space where India comes together as a country is its general election. Which is why, an election season resembles a festival of choices rather than a mere mechanical process of choosing.
India Votes for the World to Emulate
In the previous national edition in 2019, the Election Commission confirmed a 67 per cent turnout. The Americans were marginally higher in the same period while voting in their elections. The Indian elections have also been among the most expensive elections, in which political parties spent more than 7 billion in 2019, higher than the spends in the US elections in that period. Not only are the Indian general elections the largest poll show on earth — they are also the most intensely contested and certainly, sets the bar for America to follow this November.
While wars and conflicts singe the world in most parts and certain nations have gone berserk losing their way while making choices, India proves yet again that this election festival of citizens is not only the biggest but also the most civilised and sane process on earth.

"Busy dousing fire on Swati Maliwal 'assault' row, AAP loses a week of Kejriwal's freedom and fought against itself than rivals",https://www.firstpost.com/india/busy-dousing-fire-on-swati-maliwal-assault-row-aap-loses-a-week-of-kejriwals-freedom-and-fought-against-itself-than-rivals-13772369.html,"Amid the escalating blame game, the focus abruptly moved from Arvind Kejriwal to Swati Maliwal and the internal feud between Maliwal and other AAP members overshadowed Kejriwal&rsquo;s continuous attacks on the prime minister and the BJP","When the Supreme Court granted interim bail to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on 10 May until 2 June, the AAP leader had a clear agenda ahead. Arrested on 21 March by the Enforcement Directorate in the liquor policy case, Kejriwal now had 21 days to capitalise on his temporary release. His primary focus would have been to generate publicity for himself and the AAP by intensifying his criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP.
Advertisement The Maliwal incident: A shift in focus
This situation progressed smoothly until the Swati Maliwal incident on 13 May. On that day, AAP Rajya Sabha MP Swati Maliwal accused Bibhav Kumar, a member of Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal&rsquo;s personal staff of misconduct. Following her allegations, the Delhi Police arrested Kejriwal&rsquo;s private assistant Bibhav Kumar, igniting a dual conflict: AAP versus BJP and Swati Maliwal versus the rest of AAP.
Amid the escalating blame game, two significant shifts occurred. First, the focus abruptly moved from Arvind Kejriwal to Swati Maliwal. Second, the internal feud between Maliwal and other AAP members overshadowed Kejriwal&rsquo;s continuous attacks on the prime minister and the BJP.
Significantly, this incident consumed a crucial portion of Kejriwal&rsquo;s 21 days of freedom with an entire week diverted to the Maliwal controversy.
Strategic reorientation
Regardless of whether AAP inadvertently fell into a trap or recognised the situation belatedly, Kejriwal understood the pressing need to redirect attention back to himself. He needed to refocus the battle onto BJP territory and distance the party from the Maliwal incident. Whether it was genuine support for his long-time aide Kumar or a strategy to revitalise AAP, the Delhi chief minister knew that a significant move was necessary to reclaim the spotlight.
What better way to do it than challenge Prime Minister Modi to arrest all AAP leaders as he announced on Saturday that he would march to BJP headquarters in Delhi on Sunday at noon accompanied by all the prominent leaders of his party. More the chaos better the publicity.
Advertisement Kejriwal alleged that the BJP was trying to completely destroy AAP through Operation Jhadu. He shared that people who were familiar with both the BJP and him had informed him that Prime Minister Modi acknowledged AAP&rsquo;s growing influence and the global discussion around their work. Kejriwal said that the BJP saw AAP as a potential tough challenger in several states and wanted to eliminate them. He made these statements while addressing the press at the party office on Sunday.
Importance of Delhi for AAP
Voting for all seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi is scheduled for 25 May as part of Phase 6 of the polling.
Advertisement Delhi is of paramount importance to the AAP for several reasons. It is the party&rsquo;s primary base and stronghold where it was founded and first achieved significant political success by winning the Delhi Legislative Assembly elections in 2013. Maintaining control over Delhi is essential for AAP&rsquo;s political legitimacy and influence. Furthermore, Delhi serves as a showcase for AAP&rsquo;s governance model and policies.
AAP finds itself grappling with the challenge of maintaining a focussed engagement with its diverse electorate in Delhi, which encompasses various socioeconomic groups. Amid its efforts to highlight flagship programmes such as mohalla clinics, subsidised electricity and its work in government schools, the controversy surrounding Maliwal has diverted public attention from these areas which AAP would have wanted to bring in front of the voters.
Advertisement Whether the Maliwal incident is indeed a premeditated attack on AAP as the party alleges or simply a coincidence only time will reveal. However, there is no doubt that it has placed AAP in a defensive position precisely when it was gearing up for a strong offensive. Whether it&rsquo;s a calculated move by a political mastermind or just an unfortunate stroke of fate remains uncertain for now.

How Swati Maliwal row is disrupting Arvind Kejriwal’s campaign for Lok Sabha polls,https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/swati-maliwal-row-arvind-kejriwal-13772041.html,"While Arvind Kejriwal&rsquo;s release from jail to campaign for the Lok Sabha polls came as a big relief to the AAP and the Opposition, the Swati Maliwal controversy has cast a pall over proceedings. While the Delhi chief minister has remained mum over the matter, the party has claimed that there is a &lsquo;BJP conspiracy&rsquo; to frame him","Arvind Kejriwal must have felt great relief when he was granted bail by the Supreme Court.
The apex court granted the Delhi chief minister bail in the alleged money laundering case in order to campaign for the Lok Sabha polls.
But the controversy over Swati Maliwal has dogged Kejriwal at every step.
Maliwal, the AAP&rsquo;s Rajya Sabha MP, filed an FIR on Thursday accusing the Delhi chief minister&rsquo;s aide Bibhav Kumar of assaulting her. Advertisement The AAP has alleged a conspiracy is being hatched against Kejriwal, while the BJP has demanded stringent action against the accused.
Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at how the row has disrupted his campaign:
Kejriwal&rsquo;s release from jail was a big boost to the party and the Opposition.
The Times of India quoted Sandeep Pathak, a close aide of Kejriwal who is overseeing the AAP Lok Sabha campaign, as saying the development breathed fresh life into the party.
&ldquo;With him, the cadre feels happier, much more positive, much more charged. That’s one aspect of it. The other is that the BJP thought that they would get Kejriwal arrested and then start breaking up the AAP in Delhi and Punjab. But they miserably failed,&rdquo; the AAP Rajya Sabha MP said.
But Maliwal&rsquo;s accusations have now cast a pall over proceedings.
&ldquo;While the whole truth is not out yet, all is certainly not well inside the AAP. There have been reports of differences between Kejriwal and Maliwal for some time. There are claims that Kejriwal was not happy with Maliwal&rsquo;s absence from Delhi before and after his arrest as well as her relative silence on his arrest. Maliwal, however, was reportedly visiting her sister in the US,&rdquo; the piece stated.
It noted that if Kejriwal is sent to jail again for a long time, the party is likely to fracture. But if he is granted regular bail, he will likely be able to keep his team together.
&ldquo;What was supposed to be a few weeks of respite for Kejriwal are proving to be a testing period. His attention will now be divided between the election campaign and the party affairs,&rdquo; the piece noted.
Advertisement On Wednesday some people also raised slogans during Kejriwal&rsquo;s road show in Chandni Chowk against Kumar, as per The Times of India.
&lsquo;Slapped, hit in stomach&rsquo;
Maliwal in her FIR filed Thursday claimed she was &ldquo;slapped, hit in the stomach and kicked&rdquo; by Kumar.
The FIR was registered after Maliwal&rsquo;s statement was recorded by a two-member team led by Additional Commissioner of Police P.S. Kushwaha.
The team was at Maliwal&rsquo;s residence in central Delhi for nearly four and a half hours.
AAP Rajya Sabha MP Swati Maliwal has accused Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal&rsquo;s aide of assault. PTI File Photo Maliwal claimed she ran out of the CM&rsquo;s residence and called the police immediately after the incident.
Kejriwal was present at his residence when the incident took place, she added.
Advertisement Maliwal broke down several times while giving the statement and sought strict action against Kumar.
The AAP MP on Thursday underwent medical check-up at All India Institute of Medical Sciences.
Kejriwal evades question, BJP attacks
Adding fuel to the fire, Kejriwal on Wednesday did not address Maliwal&rsquo;s allegations during a press conference.
Kejriwal, flanked by Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav and AAP Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh, evaded a question on the subject.
Singh, however, said his party has already made its stand clear on the issue.
#WATCH | Lucknow, UP: On AAP Rajya Sabha MP Swati Maliwal&#39;s assault case, AAP MP Sanjay Singh says &quot;The entire country was in pain after seeing what happened in Manipur but PM Modi was silent on the issue.

&mdash; ANI (@ANI) May 16, 2024 Advertisement Singh, who had met Maliwal at her residence on Wednesday, said, &ldquo;The AAP is our family. Party has made its view clear.&rdquo;
He also targeted the BJP government at the Centre by raising the issue of a Manipuri woman being paraded naked, the Prajwal Revanna sex scandal and Maliwal being &ldquo;beaten up&rdquo; by police during protests by wrestlers when she was the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) chief.
Advertisement &ldquo;I want that BJP and PM should also answer on the issues I have kept before you. He (PM) should answer on the issue of Swati Maliwal, who was dragged and beaten when she went to seek justice for the female wrestlers. I just want to say don&rsquo;t play political games on the issues,&rdquo; he said.
Yadav then took the microphone and said &ldquo;there are more important things than that&rdquo;.
Then, unfolding a piece of paper, he added, &ldquo;BJP people are not with anyone, it is a &lsquo;gang&rsquo; that lodges false cases&rdquo;.
Singh at a press conference on Tuesday had accepted that Kumar had &ldquo;misbehaved&rdquo; with Maliwal.
He also labelled the incident &lsquo;highly condemnable&rsquo;, as per The Times of India.
BJP national spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia claimed that Kejriwal is the main &ldquo;criminal&rdquo; in the complaint that his aide Kumar had physically attacked Maliwal at the chief minister&rsquo;s residence, as he cited the telephone call she had made to the Delhi Police to report the matter.
&ldquo;His (Kejriwal) silence speaks a lot. Out of jail, he is more a &lsquo;goonda&rsquo; than a chief minister,&rdquo; he told reporters, noting that Kumar was seen with the chief minister in Lucknow.
Stringent action should be taken against the accused in the case, he said.
Kumar, he noted, was photographed with Kejriwal during his visit to Lucknow.
On Friday, the Delhi BJP Mahila Morcha members staged a protest near Kejriwal&rsquo;s residence.
Led by Mahila Morcha president Richa Pandey Mishra, the protesters, who were carrying bangles, demanded Kejriwal&rsquo;s resignation.
Mishra said the Mahila Morcha wanted to hand over the bangles to Kejriwal for keeping mum over the incident with Maliwal that occurred at his official residence.
“Arvind Kejriwal should be ashamed. He should resign from his post and apologise to the country. Swati Maliwal should get justice,&quot; a Mahila Morcha member told PTI.
The Mahila Morcha of the Delhi BJP also extended support to Maliwal, writing a letter to her saying the incident was a matter of honour of women in the country.
A team of the Delhi Police also turned up at Kejriwal&rsquo;s residence on Friday, as per India Today.
&lsquo;BJP conspiracy to frame Kejirwal&rsquo;
Meanwhile, the AAP has claimed the case is a &lsquo;BJP conspiracy to frame Kejriwal.&rsquo;
Senior AAP leader Atishi at a press conference said, &ldquo;Today a video has surfaced that has exposed the lie of Maliwal. In her FIR, she has said she was brutally assaulted and she was in pain, and buttons of her shirt were torn. A video that has surfaced shows an entirely different reality.&rdquo;
Atishi said the video shows Maliwal &ldquo;comfortably sitting in the drawing room&rdquo; and &ldquo;threatening the security staff&rdquo;, and that &ldquo;her clothes were not torn&rdquo;.
&ldquo;The video shows her threatening Kumar. The charges levelled by Maliwal are baseless. Maliwal insisted on meeting Kejriwal. She is Rajya Sabha MP and she should know that the CM has a busy schedule. Kumar told her that the chief minister is busy and unable to meet her. She shouted at him, pushed him and tried to enter the residential portion of the CM House,&rdquo; she claimed.
&ldquo;The whole incident proves that it was a BJP conspiracy and Swati Maliwal was made its face to frame Kejriwal,&rdquo; she alleged.
Asked about Singh accepting misbehaviour with Maliwal, Atishi said, &ldquo;AAP MP Sanjay Singh met Maliwal and he had only her version. But now this video has brought out the truth.&rdquo;

In Graphics | What News18 exit poll predicts about your state in Lok Sabha election 2024,https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/lok-sabha-elections-news18-exit-poll-state-wise-results-nda-indi-alliance-in-graphics-13777629.html,The voting in the Lok Sabha elections is over and exit polls are out. Here&rsquo;s what the News18 exit poll has predicted for the NDA and the INDI Alliance in some of the big states,"The voting for the Lok Sabha elections has come to an end and it’s been a lengthy process — seven long phases spread over six weeks. Now, it’s time to shift attention to the results. Before the results are announced on 4 June, here’s what the exit polls reveal.
Most exit polls are predicting a return of the Narendra Modi-led NDA government, winning over 350 seats, with the Opposition’s INDI Alliance managing somewhere between 125 and 150. News18 conducted its own mega exit poll, according to which NDA has bagged 355-370 seats, while the INDI Alliance has won 125-140 seats.
Advertisement But how has the NDA fared against the INDI Alliance in each state? We break through the clutter and present the results of the News18 mega exit poll in quick, easy graphics.
NORTH
The NDA, as per News18&rsquo;s exit poll, will continue its dominance in the north. In Uttar Pradesh, the NDA is poised to win 68-71 of the 80 seats, while the INDI Alliance is predicted to win nine-12 seats.
In Bihar, the NDA, of which Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s JDU is a part, will be bagging 31-34 seats, while INDI Alliance is believed to get six-nine seats. Delhi and Haryana is all about the NDA once again.
SOUTH
In the South, it seems a Narendra Modi-led push has helped the BJP. Exit polls predict an improved performance of the BJP in the five southern states. It seems in Andhra Pradesh, the alliance with Chandrababu Naidu-led Telugu Desam Party has paid big dividends for the BJP, with the NDA emerging on top. In Telangana, the News18 exit poll gives BJP a big reason to smile, predicting the party to win seven-10 seats, compared to Congress’ five-eight.
Karnataka is also expected to vote overwhelmingly for the BJP, despite its preference for the Congress at the state level. In Tamil Nadu, the party is even expected to make a debut, securing between one-three seats, exit polls predict.
Advertisement The Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) is set to sweep Kerala once, while the BJP-led NDA will open its account in the southern state.
EAST
The News18 exit poll predicts that the BJP-led NDA will build on its 2019 performance in the east. In West Bengal, the BJP seems to be the biggest winner, with the Mamata Banerjee led TMC trailing behind. And in Assam, it&rsquo;s NDA all the way, predicted to win 10-13 seats.
Another big surprise is from the state of Odisha. The exit poll has predicted a clean sweep for the BJP. The poll predicts the BJP will win 13-15 seats, with the BJD to come in second with six-eight seats.
Advertisement WEST
In the West, the BJP-led NDA is predicted to be the big winner as per the exit poll. Gujarat is the big news here with the NDA set to be sweeping all 26 seats. Meanwhile, in Maharashtra, the NDA is predicted to win 32-35 seats, with the INDI Alliance winning 15-18 seats.
In Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, it&rsquo;s all about the NDA once again. The News18 exit poll predicts 26-29 seats for the NDA out of the 29 seats. In Rajasthan, the NDA is predicted to win 18-25 seats.

But how did they fare in 2014 and 2019? Which pollster got it right and which missed the mark?","Voting for the seventh and final phase of the Lok Sabha polls concluded today.
Now, with the counting of votes scheduled for 4 June, all eyes are on the exit polls. The exit polls have been released at 6.30 pm.
This is in line with the Section 126A of the Representation of the People’s Act, 1951, which states that exit polls can only be aired half an hour after the completion of the final phase of voting.
Advertisement But what did they predict in 2014 and 2019? And how accurate are exit polls really?
Let’s take a closer look:
2014
Going into 2014, pollsters were under some pressure.
After all, the exit polls had failed to get it right in back-to-back Lok Sabha elections.
In 2004, the polls predicated that the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA, which was relying on the ‘India shining’ campaign, would win big.
However, the Congress made a huge comeback in 2004.
In 2009, the exit polls predicted the UPA would get the most seats, but that the result would be a hung Parliament.
The Congress-led coalition defied the odds yet again with the Grand Old Party itself getting 200 seats.
In 2014, all the exit polls favoured the BJP-led NDA under Narendra Modi.
For NDA
The News24-Chanakya poll predicted that the NDA would nab 340 seats, while the India Today-Cicero poll gave the coalition 272 seats. The CNN-IBN-CSDS said the alliance would win 280 seats, while the Times Now poll gave the NDA.
The ABP News-Nielsen predicted 274 seats for the NDA, while the NDTV-Hansa Research estimated 279 seats for the NDA.
For UPA
For the UPA, the India Today-Cicero pollster predicted 115 seats, while News 24-Chanakya estimated 101 seats. The CNN-IBN-CSDS gave the alliance 97 seats, while Times Now projected 148 seats.
Advertisement The ABP News-Nielsen said the UPA would win 97 seats, while NDTV-Hansa Research said the alliance would net 103 seats.
Pollsters seemed to underestimate the hunger for change in the public mind as well as the sheer scale of the NDA’s victory and the UPA’s defeat.
Of all the pollsters, the News24-Chanakya was most on the money.

The UPA, on the other hand, would be reduced to just 60 seats with the Congress winning 44 seats by its lonesome.
2019 polls
In 2019, most pollsters predicted that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA government would return – albeit with a reduced margin.
For NDA
The India Today-Axis pollster predicted that the NDA would win between 339 and 365 seats, while the News 24-Today’s Chanakya gave the alliance 350 seats.
The News18-IPSOS poll said the NDA would net 336 seats, while Times Now-VMR predicted 306 seats for the NDA.
The India TV-CNX pollster estimated 300 seats for the alliance, while the Sudarshan News poll gave the NDA 305 seats.

Meanwhile, for the UPA, the India Today-Axi poll predicted between 77 and 108 seats, while the News 24-Today’s Chanakya estimated 95 seats.
The News18-IPSOS poll said the UPA would win 82 seats, while the Times Now-VMR poll gave the alliance 132 seats.
The India TV-CNX predicted 120 seats for the UPA, while Sudarshan News estimated the alliance would net 124 seats.
The India Today-Axis gave the UPA between 77 and 108 seats, while News 24-Today’s Chanakya predicted 95 seats.
Most of the pollsters yet again failed to gauge the popularity of the BJP-led NDA.
Advertisement The NDA, incredibly, ended up bettering its 2014 tally in a resounding vote of confidence in Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The alliance won 352 seats with the BJP itself winning 303 seats.
Meanwhile, the Congress-led UPA expanded its tally to 91 seats with the grand old party winning 52 seats – but it was nothing to write home about.
The News 24-Today’s Chanakya was yet again the most accurate pollster.
Are exit polls accurate?
Not necessarily.
As noted above, pollsters have been off the mark with remarkable frequency in at least four recent Lok Sabha elections including 2004 and 2009.
Exit polls are also often condemned for being biased, relying on skewed data or improper sample size, and being sponsored or politically motivated, Business Standard.
The Economic Times quoted TK Arun as saying, “Exit polls are tricky in India. Indians are prudent people. Why would they tell a pollster anything other than what they figure out the pollster wants to hear? Suppose he voted Congress, and says so to the pollster, the BJP wins the election and extracts from pollsters details of all those who said they voted Congress, what mayhem might not follow? Why take the risk? Indians can be rational when the issue at stake is lack of faith as well.”
In short, exit polls can be hazardous to a political junkie’s health.

Lok Sabha Election 2024: How are exit polls conducted and are they accurate?,https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-are-exit-polls-conducted-how-accurate-are-exit-polls-lok-sabha-elections-2024-exit-polls-general-elections-13777162.html,"The largest democratic exercise in the world, India&rsquo;s 18th Lok Sabha Elections, concludes today. Following the 44-day electoral process, exit polls will commence, providing predictions on the likely victors and the extent of their triumph. What are these polls? Do they always get it right?","India&rsquo;s 18th Lok Sabha Elections, the largest democratic exercise on the planet, will conclude on 1 June, 2024 as the seventh phase comes to a close . As the lengthy 44-day electoral process ends, attention will shift to exit polls, which are expected to provide insights into the election outcomes starting from 6:30 pm on 1 June.
Exit polls are crucial for gauging the mood of the electorate and predicting the likely winners before the official results are declared. However, their accuracy and methodology are often subjects of debate and scrutiny.
Advertisement What is the methodology behind exit polls?
Exit polls are conducted by surveying voters immediately after they cast their votes. This method contrasts with opinion polls, which are conducted before the elections to gather voters&rsquo; views on various issues and candidates. Exit polls aim to provide a snapshot of voting trends, influenced by various factors such as issues, personalities, and party loyalties.
The methodology of exit polls involves interviewing voters outside polling stations using a structured questionnaire. This approach relies on the voters&rsquo; recent experiences, increasing the likelihood of obtaining accurate responses.

AP The data collected is then analysed to estimate vote shares and predict seat outcomes. These polls are typically conducted by private firms or media organisations rather than government agencies.
How has technology changed conducting exit polls?
Technological advancements have significantly influenced the conduct of exit polls. Techniques such as call-backs to respondents, images of interviews being conducted, phone calls from the field, and WhatsApp groups have enhanced data collection and analysis.
Despite these advancements, ensuring the accuracy of predictions remains challenging due to the complex and diverse nature of the Indian electorate.

AP Structured questionnaires are vital for coherent data collection and systematic analysis, reported Indian Express. The Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) emphasises the importance of representative samples in ensuring accurate predictions. A large sample size is crucial, but the representativeness of the sample is equally important.
Advertisement What challenges are faced while conducting exit polls?
Estimating vote shares and predicting seat outcomes are the primary challenges in conducting exit polls. The swing model, which relies on past election results, is influenced by various factors such as geographic location, caste, religion, and economic class.
Changes in political alliances between elections can also affect predictions. The prediction process is labour-intensive and time-consuming, as it involves making estimates for each seat.

AP The complexity of swings increases with the number of political players. For example, the BJP and JD(U) alliance in Bihar poses a challenge for the swing model. Over- or under-representation of diverse voter sections can impact the accuracy of estimates.
Advertisement How accurate are exit polls?
The accuracy of exit polls depends on various factors beyond sample size. The representativeness of the sample, the methodology used, and the ability to account for diverse voter profiles are critical. Some agencies rely on innovative methods, such as eliminating certain constituencies from the poll, to improve accuracy.

Their predictions have varied in accuracy, highlighting the complexities involved in electoral predictions.
Have exit polls ever got it wrong?
Historically, exit polls have had mixed accuracy. Some notable instances where exit polls diverged significantly from actual results include:
Advertisement 2004 Lok Sabha Elections: Exit polls predicted a majority for the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA government. However, the actual results saw the NDA falling short of expectations.
Delhi Assembly Elections 2015: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) secured a sweeping victory with 67 out of 70 seats, which was underestimated by exit polls.
Bihar Assembly Elections 2015: Exit polls predicted a close race, but the RJD-JDU-Congress coalition won decisively.
UP Assembly Elections 2017: Despite exit polls predicting a hung assembly, the BJP won over 300 seats.
2014 Lok Sabha Elections: Exit polls did not foresee the BJP achieving an outright majority, which it did by crossing the 272-mark on its own.
In India, exit polls are regulated under Section 126A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. This section prohibits the conduct and publication of exit polls during the polling period to avoid influencing voters.

Why are exit polls released after all votes are cast? Why are they relevant?,https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-are-exit-polls-released-after-all-votes-are-cast-why-are-they-relevant-13776094.html,Exit polls are essentially quick interviews with voters.

They are aimed at predicting which party is likely to come to power,"The Election Commission has ordered that no exit polls be conducted prior to 6.30 pm on 1 June. The seventh and final phase of the Lok Sabha polls is underway with 57 parliamentary constituencies set to cast their vote across eight states and union territories.
The counting for the Lok Sabha Elections 2024 will take place on 4 June.
But what do we know about exit polls? What is their history? Why are they relevant? And what about their rules?

What are they?
Exit polls are essentially quick interviews with voters.
They are usually conducted right after voters exit the polls on voting day – as opposed to opinion polls which are conducted beforehand.
The idea behind them is to offer a snapshot of the voters’ concerns. They are aimed at predicting which party is likely to come to power.
Several news channels and agencies in India conduct exit polls – with varying degrees of success.
As per Business Standard, their accuracy depends on a slew of factors including structured questionnaires, in-person or telephonic interviews of random people for fairness, sample size, demographic representation, data compilation, and count method.
The first exit poll was conducted in 1957 by the Indian Institute of Public Opinion.
The group conducted an exit poll during the second Lok Sabha elections.
As per Hindustan Times, it was the Delhi-based Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) that pioneered in the 1960s.
But it was another two decades before exit polls began being taken seriously in the media.
This is when psephologist Prannoy Roy teamed up with David Butler.
Advertisement Roy, Butler and Ashok Lahiri would go on to publish a landmark book The Compendium of Indian Elections.
State-run Doordarshan asking the CSDS to conduct a countrywide exit poll in 1996 also brought exit polls further into the mainstream.
“Without a structured questionnaire, the data can neither be collected coherently nor be analysed systematically to arrive at vote share estimates,” Indian Express quoted Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) director Sanjay Kumar as saying.
What are the rules for exit polls?
Exit polls are governed by The Representation of People Act, 1951.
Section 126 A of the act restricts publication and dissemination of exit polls results.
Advertisement Exit polls are usually conducted right after voters exit the polls on voting day – as opposed to opinion polls which are conducted beforehand. PTI It states, “No person shall conduct any exit poll and publish or publicise by means of the print or electronic media or disseminate in any other manner, whatsoever, the result of any exit poll during such period, as may be notified by the Election Commission in this regard.”
It adds that in case of a general election, the period may commence from the beginning of the hours fixed for the poll on the first day and continue till half an hour after the closing of the poll in all the States and Union territories.
According to Business Standard, this is done so that exit polls don’t influence voters or voting patterns.
Advertisement Those who violate this provision can be sentenced to a prison term of up to two years, a fine or both.
The Election Commission first issued guidelines on exit polls in 1998. The EC under Article 324 of the Constitution barred newspapers and television news channels from publishing or broadcasting results of opinion and exit polls between 5 pm on 14 February 1998 and 5 pm on 7 March 1998. The first phase in that year’s general elections began on 16 February 1998, and the final phase began on 7 March.
As per Economic Times, the EC in 2022 said news broadcasters must not air any final, formal and definite results &ldquo;until such results are formally announced by the Election Commission of India, unless such results are carried with clear disclaimer that they are unofficial or incomplete or partial results or projections which should not be taken as final results.&rdquo;
Advertisement Why are exit polls relevant?
Because people want to know which party and candidates are likely to win &ndash; and quickly.
However, critics say that they are often left wanting when it comes to accuracy.
According to Business Standard, exit polls are also often condemned for being biased, relying on skewed data or improper sample size, and being sponsored or politically motivated. The Economic Times quoted TK Arun as saying, &ldquo;Exit polls are tricky in India. Indians are prudent people. Why would they tell a pollster anything other than what they figure out the pollster wants to hear? Suppose he voted Congress, and says so to the pollster, the BJP wins the election and extracts from pollsters details of all those who said they voted Congress, what mayhem might not follow? Why take the risk? Indians can be rational when the issue at stake is lack of faith as well.&rdquo;
In the past, exit polls have had both hits and misses galore.
According to Hindustan Times, except for the 1998 and 2014 polls, at least four Lok Sabha polls have gotten it badly wrong.
This includes two back-to-back predictions in 2004 and 2009.
The 2004 exit polls in particular were a massive failure with the pollsters completely missing the Congress coming back to power as the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA with its ‘India Shining’ slogan lost its majority.
All exit polls predicted a win for the BJP.
Again in 2009, while most pollsters gave the edge to the UPA, they completely missed a huge swing in its favour.
The UPA added 40 more seats to its tally.
A man looks at a television screen showing exit poll results after the last phase of the general election in Ahmedabad on 19 May 2019. File photo/Reuters In 2014, the BJP won over 330 seats.
While most pollsters said then prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi and the BJP-led NDA would cross the 272 mark, almost none of them forecast the decisive performance.
It was only pollster Chanakya, who predicted 340 seats for the NDA, that came close to getting it spot on.
In 2019, most pollsters predicted that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA government would return &ndash; albeit with a reduced margin compared to the previous election. Of course, we know that the pollsters yet again underestimated the strength of the BJP-led NDA, which would nab 353 seats.

"Predictions, predilections, and Indian general elections",https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/predictions-predilections-and-indian-general-elections-13775669.html,Election predictions are notoriously hard due to the changing nature of the parameters,"Predictions are awfully difficult, even with the reassuring crunch of numbers! And yet, they are our fatal predilection, whether the challenge is for our pleasure or for that of others. Be it the stock market, astrology, or gambling, our insatiable curiosity for the mysterious and unknown is probably what propels such abandonment.
Take the ongoing Lok Sabha polls, going on for perhaps too long now, and the concomitant barrage of prophecies from TV channels, from YouTube “influenczars” and from downright bored individuals, all of whom shoot off their incendiary numbers into the tinder of social media. These soothsayers speak from relative ignorance and mostly from a fascination for a particular party, be they pidis or bhakts.They speak with the confidence that they can actually fool all the people all the time, with Abraham Lincoln being the ultimate fool, poor man. What is most horrendous is that all of them have declared random numbers like 180, 200, 250, 272, 303, 320, 362, 370, and the ace of spades, 400, long before all the votes have come in. This is why I liken election predictions in India to gambling. It is matka guessing in a satta bazar. Parrot talk, or tarot talk, it leads to no concrete outcome. It does not affect the choices made by the voters, choices one suspects were cast in stone, long before the elections were even announced. And yet, these delirious djinns persist, as their minds are made up too. The happy side to this sad fantasy is that it is time-bound, and we can all reclaim our normal lives on June 4.
Advertisement Lighter comments aside, there is a more serious side to prediction, based on the assumption that future events are influenced to some or a greater extent by what has happened before. History is our greatest teacher. The art and science of good prediction lie in identifying which past (or present) event will likely influence an event to come. Let us take the Indian monsoon, an annual event of major economic importance to our nation, and one that has just begun this year. It would help the government enormously if it knew a few months in advance if the monsoon were to be normal, below average, or will punch above its weight.
At present, the Indian monsoon is predicted using a combination of atmospheric models, sea surface temperature analysis, historical data, and satellite observations. Key factors include the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, the Indian Ocean Dipole, and wind patterns. Advanced computational models simulate these variables to forecast rainfall and monsoon onset accurately. However, there are totally different methods of monsoon prediction that would not be considered ‘scientific’ by western definition, but are yet chillingly accurate. Traditionally, some Indian communities predict the monsoon by observing the nesting behaviour of certain birds, like the Indian weaver bird (Baya Weaver). It is believed that if these birds build their nests on higher branches, a heavier monsoon will ensue. Conversely, lower nests indicate lighter rainfall. This method relies on the birds&rsquo; instinctive response to environmental cues, and seems to be largely reliable. Nature lovers might like to correlate this occurrence with the Japanese kō or 72 micro-seasons, for further poetic justification.
Advertisement Prediction is a key aspect of science, and the smaller the number of known events, phenomena, and parameters used to predict a large number of future events accurately, the better the value of the prediction. At the risk of introducing an equation in this column, one can say the value of a prediction, V = (N/n) – 1, where one is able to correctly predict N outcomes with n parameters. According to this equation, the value of a prediction is zero if one needs n parameters to predict N outcomes.
Let’s apply this equation to the present Lok Sabha election. We could say that N = 543, in other words, we want to correctly predict the results from 543 constituencies. How many parameters would we need, or what is the value of n, for a good prediction? What our present-day pollsters are doing, in trying to improve the accuracy of their guesses, is to increase the number of parameters to absurd levels. They ask whether all the Muslim women in Kishanganj will vote like their menfolk, whether the hot summer days in Ramagundam will harm voting, or whether all the Gounders in Kovai will stay loyal to the AIADMK. The problem with such micro-parameters is that they cannot be quantified properly. Informal surveys on the ground may not be the answer because all respondents may not answer truthfully. We see ludicrous statements from politicians—some say that low turnouts hurt the BJP, while others say that low turnouts hurt the Congress. Others say that a low or high turnout may help or hurt a party, depending on the state. Still others say that whatever happens, Congress is winning. The problem with any or all of this is that none of it can be either proven or disproven—this makes it non-scientific. The reader will appreciate that as n increases with all these unprovable parameters, the value of the prediction quickly goes to zero. It is easier to say that there is only one parameter in this election, and that is the prime minister himself. Applying the equation, the value of my prediction is (543/1) – 1 = 542, which in practical terms means a sizable majority for the BJP. I think I’m doing pretty well for myself with this prediction. June 4 will tell.
Advertisement What I would have liked to see, and what seems missing, is a more accurate assessment of ‘swing’ constituencies in bellwether states. No expert needs to predict that the BJP will win in Gandhinagar or that it will lose in South Kolkata. On the other hand, if the BJP were to win in Thiruvananthapuram, Bengaluru Rural, Hyderabad, or Central Chennai, this would signify that winds of change are blowing across the country. The very high voter turnout in Baramulla is another pointer. An ability to extrapolate from this to an accurate prediction about the Kashmir Valley in particular and the country in general, is what is missing. Once again, what I would like to see on June 4 is how soon any particular TV channel is able to call the election, say by 9, 10, or 11 am? The sooner it is able to do this, the better its reports will be and the less fluff and bluff.
Advertisement Election predictions are notoriously hard due to the changing nature of the parameters, something we do not usually see in science. The Truman-Dewey US presidential election of 1945, was made memorable by the photograph of the victor, Harry Truman, brandishing a copy of the Chicago Tribune that screamed the wrong headline, “Dewey defeats Truman”. So close was the vote. At the end of World War II, the UK voted against Winston Churchill, their doughty PM, who had saved them from Nazi tyranny. He was hustled out of office when the Labour Party won by a substantial majority. Can we ever imagine a similar situation in India? And yet, some of our own elections have indeed yielded surprising results, and one recollects 1971, 1977, and 2019, when the decisiveness of the mandate was quite something else.

Before the sixth and seventh phases on 25 May and 1 June, the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) has carried out an analysis, which shows that 1,644 of the 8,337 candidates contesting in the ongoing Lok Sabha elections have criminal cases registered against them.
Of these candidates, 1,188 face serious criminal charges, including allegations of murder, attempted murder, crimes against women, and hate speech.
Advertisement Here is a phase-by-phase analysis.
Phase 1: 19 April
In phase 1, out of 1,618 candidates analysed, 252 have criminal cases and 161 serious criminal cases.
According to the ADR, seven candidates face murder charges, while 19 are involved in attempted murder cases. Eighteen candidates have declared cases of crimes against women in their affidavits, with one facing a rape charge under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).
Another 35 candidates are linked to cases of hate speech.
Phase 2: 26 April
In the second phase, 1,192 candidates were analysed with 250 of them facing criminal charges and 167 serious criminal cases. Three candidates face murder charges, while 24 are involved in attempted murder cases, the report revealed.
Twenty-five candidates have declared cases related to crimes against women, with one facing rape charges under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The analysis revealed that twenty-one candidates have been linked to cases of hate speech.
It also revealed that 52 per cent of the 87 seats in the second phase of seven-phase elections are &lsquo;red alert&rsquo; constituencies. ‘Red alert’ constituencies are those where three or more candidates have declared criminal cases in their affidavits.
Phase 3: 7 May
In phase 3, out of 1,352 candidates, 244 have criminal cases and 172 serious criminal cases, 18 per cent of the total candidates in the fray.
Advertisement Among the 244 candidates with criminal records, five face murder charges, while 24 have been booked for attempted murder.
In addition, 38 candidates have been linked to crimes against women, with 17 declared cases of hate speech.
Seven candidates have also declared prior convictions.
Phase 4: 13 May
Phase 4 had the highest number — of the 1,710 candidates analysed, 360 have criminal charges against them and 274 serious criminal charges.
According to the data, 17 of the 360 candidates (21 per cent) with criminal cases were convicted, 11 declared cases of murder, 30 face attempted murder charges, and 50 have criminal cases related to crimes against women, with 5 facing rape charges.
Advertisement Phase 5: 20 May
Phase 5 included 695 candidates, of which 159 have criminal cases and 122 serious criminal cases. Around 18 per cent were facing serious criminal charges, including those related to murder, attempted murder, and crimes against women.
Twenty-eight of these candidates are charged with attempted murder (IPC Section 307), while four are charged with murder (IPC Section 302).

Beyond the Lines | Indian elections: What the biggest show on earth can teach the world,https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/beyond-the-lines-indian-elections-what-the-biggest-show-on-earth-can-teach-the-world-13773225.html,"Not only are the Indian general elections the largest poll show on earth — they are also the most intensely contested and certainly, sets the bar for America to follow this November","This was going to be the global election year that decides the fate of the world. This was also going to be the biggest election in the world’s biggest democracy. With over 900 million broadband subscribers, the Indian voter is more plugged into the commentary of the voting analysis, trends and outcomes.
The cacophony of election analysis is hardwired into the heads of Indian citizens through their phones and devices, their choices dictated by opinions and beliefs, which in turn has been an outcome of results seen in the last five years. Yet, when I went to cast my vote this Monday, the booth-level machinery was so well-oiled and efficient that beyond the cacophony of election sloganeering and digital pyrotechnics, the unassuming power of silent citizens dutifully stepping up to vote on their appointed day, sans drama or hyperbole, held up a useful guide for the rest of the world to emulate.
Advertisement India, the world’s most populous democracy, is currently holding its general election over a seven-phase period that continues for seven weeks. Indians can vote between 19 April and 1 June, with the results set to be declared on 4 June.
The World Decides in 2024
Over fifty elections take place in 2024, including some of the most impacting ones such as the US, Russia, India, Taiwan. Fifty-one per cent of the world will either have a new dispensation or continue with the existing one. As elections take place across the world, the festival of democracy in India is expected to be among the keenly contested, fair and well organised ones in the world.
These elections have also proved that India sets consistent standards in choosing their leaders, disproving a biased opinion about democracy and elections that certain western thinking has held towards India. Using a template of a fairness score to evaluate the independence of elections in countries, as a well-known western publication recently did, reduces the process of choices in elections to a rating number which can both end up being biased and patronising, and is dictated by a long-held expectation that Indian polls are simultaneously cantankerous and exotic — a work in progress democracy that promises to be civilised but is never one. It also served to quietly aid a narrative that the democratic processes in the west are superior.
Advertisement Why India’s Free Elections Trumps West’s Bias
Take for instance, the freedom and fairness score accorded to India’s elections, which is 0.53 and compare it to the other nations in their leadup to the elections. Mexico is a country heading for elections this year. In this election cycle, 30 candidates have already been assassinated, according to data from the research firm Laboratorio Electoral. In 2021, 30 candidates were killed while in 2018, the elections saw 24 killings. These elections are expected to be among the most violent. According to western pundits, Mexico has a freedom and fairness score of 0.75 in the conduct of elections, which indicates the elections are more ‘just and fair’ than in India. Parts of western media has been unduly harsh on India, rating its fairness score of elections at 0.53.
Advertisement In Indonesia, the electoral process is still dominated by corrupt or influential leaders who grew powerful during the authoritarian rule of Suharto. Democracy is new, and power oscillated between influential stakeholders, till Joko Widodo, an outsider, broke the stranglehold. Thereafter, a general took over as President — one the west has accused of human rights abuses. Interestingly, Indonesia’s freedom and fairness score stands at 0.68, higher than India. Which means that the credibility of Indian elections is just about better than the banana republics — an assumption that betrays the negative bias of such studies.
The US, rated high in freedom and fairness index by the publication, struggled under serious allegations of tampering and influence by Russia and the subsequent response of Trump supporters laying siege in Washington DC after losing the elections indicated a democracy that was functional but not civilised. On the other hand, far from the history of some of the nations, who have either embraced dysfunctional democracy along the way or seem to be falling by the wayside in terms of their law and order situation in the lead up to the elections, India has maintained an enviable record of holding free and fair elections over seven decades.
Advertisement The Decisive Indian Vote
From the general election held in 1951-52 in which 17.5 crore Indians, voted in the elections to the 18th Lok Sabha that are under way, the process has evolved and matured along with Indian democracy over the decades. So have the voters graduated, from being largely illiterate to being well informed and technically savvy while making choices.
The CEC explained why the voluntary nature of casting votes means that the ECI operates ‘in an entirely persuasive space, inviting the citizens to volunteer to become part of the electoral roll and, thereafter, through systematic voter awareness programmes, motivates them to exercise their franchise.’ There is a high elector to population ratio which underpins the discipline, patience and belief that Indian voters have demonstrated in executing the process. The power of Indian elections demonstrates a growing, emerging India that is willing and ready to show how democracy is a proven political system in this world. Take for instance the example of Jammu and Kashmir.
Advertisement Since 1989, all earlier elections in the region had been plagued by violence and a tendence towards anarchy, influenced by separatist parties. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Anantnag, Srinagar and Baramulla — the Lok Sabha seats — recorded dismal attendance.
Baramulla recorded 46 per cent voting in 1996. Thereafter it has struggled to have voters on election days. Twenty-eight years later, 59 per cent of Baramulla showed up to vote on polling day, breaking the previous record.
This time, local political leaders have addressed large crowds who are keen to be a part of the time-tested process of democracy and express their opinions at the poll booths, unlike earlier times when boycotts dominated Kashmiri elections and the turnout, cowed down by the gun, often struggled to crawl out of single digit percentage attendance.
The resolve to bring Kashmir out of a rut of decades-old militancy by taking the gun out of the equation has helped locals trust the power of the ballot in making lives better instead of being ruled by fear of militancy. There is a growing curiosity about the choices available in a democracy through the power of the ballot, which many people in the state now see value in, unlike across the border where democracy is in shambles and offers no choices.
Younger India: 18 Million First-Time Voters
One of the key aspects in these elections is the addition of over 2-crore young first time voters. These voters, in each successive edition, are going to boost a voting population that consumes digital information and has a strong sense of independent opinion. A keen interest among young voters has led to parties canvassing through digital platforms. An increasingly politically conscious, intelligent but less patient voter base has meant that parties have had to address more matured issues – which also tells us how India has travelled a fair distance from the days when Garibi Hatao was a dominating slogan.
The voter turnout, lower in the early stages, yet reflects an involved participation of its citizens across the country. In a country where different belief systems have held sway, the one common space where India comes together as a country is its general election. Which is why, an election season resembles a festival of choices rather than a mere mechanical process of choosing.
India Votes for the World to Emulate
In the previous national edition in 2019, the Election Commission confirmed a 67 per cent turnout. The Americans were marginally higher in the same period while voting in their elections. The Indian elections have also been among the most expensive elections, in which political parties spent more than 7 billion in 2019, higher than the spends in the US elections in that period. Not only are the Indian general elections the largest poll show on earth — they are also the most intensely contested and certainly, sets the bar for America to follow this November.
While wars and conflicts singe the world in most parts and certain nations have gone berserk losing their way while making choices, India proves yet again that this election festival of citizens is not only the biggest but also the most civilised and sane process on earth.

"Busy dousing fire on Swati Maliwal 'assault' row, AAP loses a week of Kejriwal's freedom and fought against itself than rivals",https://www.firstpost.com/india/busy-dousing-fire-on-swati-maliwal-assault-row-aap-loses-a-week-of-kejriwals-freedom-and-fought-against-itself-than-rivals-13772369.html,"Amid the escalating blame game, the focus abruptly moved from Arvind Kejriwal to Swati Maliwal and the internal feud between Maliwal and other AAP members overshadowed Kejriwal&rsquo;s continuous attacks on the prime minister and the BJP","When the Supreme Court granted interim bail to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on 10 May until 2 June, the AAP leader had a clear agenda ahead. Arrested on 21 March by the Enforcement Directorate in the liquor policy case, Kejriwal now had 21 days to capitalise on his temporary release. His primary focus would have been to generate publicity for himself and the AAP by intensifying his criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP.
Advertisement The Maliwal incident: A shift in focus
This situation progressed smoothly until the Swati Maliwal incident on 13 May. On that day, AAP Rajya Sabha MP Swati Maliwal accused Bibhav Kumar, a member of Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal&rsquo;s personal staff of misconduct. Following her allegations, the Delhi Police arrested Kejriwal&rsquo;s private assistant Bibhav Kumar, igniting a dual conflict: AAP versus BJP and Swati Maliwal versus the rest of AAP.
Amid the escalating blame game, two significant shifts occurred. First, the focus abruptly moved from Arvind Kejriwal to Swati Maliwal. Second, the internal feud between Maliwal and other AAP members overshadowed Kejriwal&rsquo;s continuous attacks on the prime minister and the BJP.
Significantly, this incident consumed a crucial portion of Kejriwal&rsquo;s 21 days of freedom with an entire week diverted to the Maliwal controversy.
Strategic reorientation
Regardless of whether AAP inadvertently fell into a trap or recognised the situation belatedly, Kejriwal understood the pressing need to redirect attention back to himself. He needed to refocus the battle onto BJP territory and distance the party from the Maliwal incident. Whether it was genuine support for his long-time aide Kumar or a strategy to revitalise AAP, the Delhi chief minister knew that a significant move was necessary to reclaim the spotlight.
What better way to do it than challenge Prime Minister Modi to arrest all AAP leaders as he announced on Saturday that he would march to BJP headquarters in Delhi on Sunday at noon accompanied by all the prominent leaders of his party. More the chaos better the publicity.
Advertisement Kejriwal alleged that the BJP was trying to completely destroy AAP through Operation Jhadu. He shared that people who were familiar with both the BJP and him had informed him that Prime Minister Modi acknowledged AAP&rsquo;s growing influence and the global discussion around their work. Kejriwal said that the BJP saw AAP as a potential tough challenger in several states and wanted to eliminate them. He made these statements while addressing the press at the party office on Sunday.
Importance of Delhi for AAP
Voting for all seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi is scheduled for 25 May as part of Phase 6 of the polling.
Advertisement Delhi is of paramount importance to the AAP for several reasons. It is the party&rsquo;s primary base and stronghold where it was founded and first achieved significant political success by winning the Delhi Legislative Assembly elections in 2013. Maintaining control over Delhi is essential for AAP&rsquo;s political legitimacy and influence. Furthermore, Delhi serves as a showcase for AAP&rsquo;s governance model and policies.
AAP finds itself grappling with the challenge of maintaining a focussed engagement with its diverse electorate in Delhi, which encompasses various socioeconomic groups. Amid its efforts to highlight flagship programmes such as mohalla clinics, subsidised electricity and its work in government schools, the controversy surrounding Maliwal has diverted public attention from these areas which AAP would have wanted to bring in front of the voters.
Advertisement Whether the Maliwal incident is indeed a premeditated attack on AAP as the party alleges or simply a coincidence only time will reveal. However, there is no doubt that it has placed AAP in a defensive position precisely when it was gearing up for a strong offensive. Whether it&rsquo;s a calculated move by a political mastermind or just an unfortunate stroke of fate remains uncertain for now.

How Swati Maliwal row is disrupting Arvind Kejriwal’s campaign for Lok Sabha polls,https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/swati-maliwal-row-arvind-kejriwal-13772041.html,"While Arvind Kejriwal&rsquo;s release from jail to campaign for the Lok Sabha polls came as a big relief to the AAP and the Opposition, the Swati Maliwal controversy has cast a pall over proceedings. While the Delhi chief minister has remained mum over the matter, the party has claimed that there is a &lsquo;BJP conspiracy&rsquo; to frame him","Arvind Kejriwal must have felt great relief when he was granted bail by the Supreme Court.
The apex court granted the Delhi chief minister bail in the alleged money laundering case in order to campaign for the Lok Sabha polls.
But the controversy over Swati Maliwal has dogged Kejriwal at every step.
Maliwal, the AAP&rsquo;s Rajya Sabha MP, filed an FIR on Thursday accusing the Delhi chief minister&rsquo;s aide Bibhav Kumar of assaulting her. Advertisement The AAP has alleged a conspiracy is being hatched against Kejriwal, while the BJP has demanded stringent action against the accused.
Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at how the row has disrupted his campaign:
Kejriwal&rsquo;s release from jail was a big boost to the party and the Opposition.
The Times of India quoted Sandeep Pathak, a close aide of Kejriwal who is overseeing the AAP Lok Sabha campaign, as saying the development breathed fresh life into the party.
&ldquo;With him, the cadre feels happier, much more positive, much more charged. That’s one aspect of it. The other is that the BJP thought that they would get Kejriwal arrested and then start breaking up the AAP in Delhi and Punjab. But they miserably failed,&rdquo; the AAP Rajya Sabha MP said.
But Maliwal&rsquo;s accusations have now cast a pall over proceedings.
&ldquo;While the whole truth is not out yet, all is certainly not well inside the AAP. There have been reports of differences between Kejriwal and Maliwal for some time. There are claims that Kejriwal was not happy with Maliwal&rsquo;s absence from Delhi before and after his arrest as well as her relative silence on his arrest. Maliwal, however, was reportedly visiting her sister in the US,&rdquo; the piece stated.
It noted that if Kejriwal is sent to jail again for a long time, the party is likely to fracture. But if he is granted regular bail, he will likely be able to keep his team together.
&ldquo;What was supposed to be a few weeks of respite for Kejriwal are proving to be a testing period. His attention will now be divided between the election campaign and the party affairs,&rdquo; the piece noted.
Advertisement On Wednesday some people also raised slogans during Kejriwal&rsquo;s road show in Chandni Chowk against Kumar, as per The Times of India.
&lsquo;Slapped, hit in stomach&rsquo;
Maliwal in her FIR filed Thursday claimed she was &ldquo;slapped, hit in the stomach and kicked&rdquo; by Kumar.
The FIR was registered after Maliwal&rsquo;s statement was recorded by a two-member team led by Additional Commissioner of Police P.S. Kushwaha.
The team was at Maliwal&rsquo;s residence in central Delhi for nearly four and a half hours.
AAP Rajya Sabha MP Swati Maliwal has accused Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal&rsquo;s aide of assault. PTI File Photo Maliwal claimed she ran out of the CM&rsquo;s residence and called the police immediately after the incident.
Kejriwal was present at his residence when the incident took place, she added.
Advertisement Maliwal broke down several times while giving the statement and sought strict action against Kumar.
The AAP MP on Thursday underwent medical check-up at All India Institute of Medical Sciences.
Kejriwal evades question, BJP attacks
Adding fuel to the fire, Kejriwal on Wednesday did not address Maliwal&rsquo;s allegations during a press conference.
Kejriwal, flanked by Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav and AAP Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh, evaded a question on the subject.
Singh, however, said his party has already made its stand clear on the issue.
#WATCH | Lucknow, UP: On AAP Rajya Sabha MP Swati Maliwal&#39;s assault case, AAP MP Sanjay Singh says &quot;The entire country was in pain after seeing what happened in Manipur but PM Modi was silent on the issue. Prajwal Revanna raped thousands of women but PM Modi was asking for votes… pic.twitter.com/nQu73jcqNQ
&mdash; ANI (@ANI) May 16, 2024 Advertisement Singh, who had met Maliwal at her residence on Wednesday, said, &ldquo;The AAP is our family. Party has made its view clear.&rdquo;
He also targeted the BJP government at the Centre by raising the issue of a Manipuri woman being paraded naked, the Prajwal Revanna sex scandal and Maliwal being &ldquo;beaten up&rdquo; by police during protests by wrestlers when she was the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) chief.
Advertisement &ldquo;I want that BJP and PM should also answer on the issues I have kept before you. He (PM) should answer on the issue of Swati Maliwal, who was dragged and beaten when she went to seek justice for the female wrestlers. I just want to say don&rsquo;t play political games on the issues,&rdquo; he said.
Yadav then took the microphone and said &ldquo;there are more important things than that&rdquo;.
Then, unfolding a piece of paper, he added, &ldquo;BJP people are not with anyone, it is a &lsquo;gang&rsquo; that lodges false cases&rdquo;.
Singh at a press conference on Tuesday had accepted that Kumar had &ldquo;misbehaved&rdquo; with Maliwal.
He also labelled the incident &lsquo;highly condemnable&rsquo;, as per The Times of India.
BJP national spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia claimed that Kejriwal is the main &ldquo;criminal&rdquo; in the complaint that his aide Kumar had physically attacked Maliwal at the chief minister&rsquo;s residence, as he cited the telephone call she had made to the Delhi Police to report the matter.
&ldquo;His (Kejriwal) silence speaks a lot. Out of jail, he is more a &lsquo;goonda&rsquo; than a chief minister,&rdquo; he told reporters, noting that Kumar was seen with the chief minister in Lucknow.
Stringent action should be taken against the accused in the case, he said.
Kumar, he noted, was photographed with Kejriwal during his visit to Lucknow.
On Friday, the Delhi BJP Mahila Morcha members staged a protest near Kejriwal&rsquo;s residence.
Led by Mahila Morcha president Richa Pandey Mishra, the protesters, who were carrying bangles, demanded Kejriwal&rsquo;s resignation.
Mishra said the Mahila Morcha wanted to hand over the bangles to Kejriwal for keeping mum over the incident with Maliwal that occurred at his official residence.
“Arvind Kejriwal should be ashamed. He should resign from his post and apologise to the country. Swati Maliwal should get justice,&quot; a Mahila Morcha member told PTI.
The Mahila Morcha of the Delhi BJP also extended support to Maliwal, writing a letter to her saying the incident was a matter of honour of women in the country.
A team of the Delhi Police also turned up at Kejriwal&rsquo;s residence on Friday, as per India Today.
&lsquo;BJP conspiracy to frame Kejirwal&rsquo;
Meanwhile, the AAP has claimed the case is a &lsquo;BJP conspiracy to frame Kejriwal.&rsquo;
Senior AAP leader Atishi at a press conference said, &ldquo;Today a video has surfaced that has exposed the lie of Maliwal. In her FIR, she has said she was brutally assaulted and she was in pain, and buttons of her shirt were torn. A video that has surfaced shows an entirely different reality.&rdquo;
Atishi said the video shows Maliwal &ldquo;comfortably sitting in the drawing room&rdquo; and &ldquo;threatening the security staff&rdquo;, and that &ldquo;her clothes were not torn&rdquo;.
&ldquo;The video shows her threatening Kumar. The charges levelled by Maliwal are baseless. Maliwal insisted on meeting Kejriwal. She is Rajya Sabha MP and she should know that the CM has a busy schedule. Kumar told her that the chief minister is busy and unable to meet her. She shouted at him, pushed him and tried to enter the residential portion of the CM House,&rdquo; she claimed.
&ldquo;The whole incident proves that it was a BJP conspiracy and Swati Maliwal was made its face to frame Kejriwal,&rdquo; she alleged.
Asked about Singh accepting misbehaviour with Maliwal, Atishi said, &ldquo;AAP MP Sanjay Singh met Maliwal and he had only her version. But now this video has brought out the truth.&rdquo;

Here&rsquo;s what the News18 exit poll has predicted for the NDA and the INDI Alliance in some of the big states,"The voting for the Lok Sabha elections has come to an end and it’s been a lengthy process — seven long phases spread over six weeks. Now, it’s time to shift attention to the results. Before the results are announced on 4 June, here’s what the exit polls reveal.
Most exit polls are predicting a return of the Narendra Modi-led NDA government, winning over 350 seats, with the Opposition’s INDI Alliance managing somewhere between 125 and 150. News18 conducted its own mega exit poll, according to which NDA has bagged 355-370 seats, while the INDI Alliance has won 125-140 seats.
Advertisement But how has the NDA fared against the INDI Alliance in each state? We break through the clutter and present the results of the News18 mega exit poll in quick, easy graphics.
NORTH
The NDA, as per News18&rsquo;s exit poll, will continue its dominance in the north. In Uttar Pradesh, the NDA is poised to win 68-71 of the 80 seats, while the INDI Alliance is predicted to win nine-12 seats.
In Bihar, the NDA, of which Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s JDU is a part, will be bagging 31-34 seats, while INDI Alliance is believed to get six-nine seats. Delhi and Haryana is all about the NDA once again.
SOUTH
In the South, it seems a Narendra Modi-led push has helped the BJP. Exit polls predict an improved performance of the BJP in the five southern states. It seems in Andhra Pradesh, the alliance with Chandrababu Naidu-led Telugu Desam Party has paid big dividends for the BJP, with the NDA emerging on top. In Telangana, the News18 exit poll gives BJP a big reason to smile, predicting the party to win seven-10 seats, compared to Congress’ five-eight.
Karnataka is also expected to vote overwhelmingly for the BJP, despite its preference for the Congress at the state level. In Tamil Nadu, the party is even expected to make a debut, securing between one-three seats, exit polls predict.
Advertisement The Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) is set to sweep Kerala once, while the BJP-led NDA will open its account in the southern state.
EAST
The News18 exit poll predicts that the BJP-led NDA will build on its 2019 performance in the east. In West Bengal, the BJP seems to be the biggest winner, with the Mamata Banerjee led TMC trailing behind. And in Assam, it&rsquo;s NDA all the way, predicted to win 10-13 seats.
Another big surprise is from the state of Odisha. The exit poll has predicted a clean sweep for the BJP. The poll predicts the BJP will win 13-15 seats, with the BJD to come in second with six-eight seats.
Advertisement WEST
In the West, the BJP-led NDA is predicted to be the big winner as per the exit poll. Gujarat is the big news here with the NDA set to be sweeping all 26 seats. Meanwhile, in Maharashtra, the NDA is predicted to win 32-35 seats, with the INDI Alliance winning 15-18 seats.
In Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, it&rsquo;s all about the NDA once again. The News18 exit poll predicts 26-29 seats for the NDA out of the 29 seats. In Rajasthan, the NDA is predicted to win 18-25 seats.

Now, with the counting of votes scheduled for 4 June, all eyes are on the exit polls. The exit polls have been released at 6.30 pm.
This is in line with the Section 126A of the Representation of the People’s Act, 1951, which states that exit polls can only be aired half an hour after the completion of the final phase of voting.
Advertisement But what did they predict in 2014 and 2019? And how accurate are exit polls really?
Let’s take a closer look:
2014
Going into 2014, pollsters were under some pressure.
After all, the exit polls had failed to get it right in back-to-back Lok Sabha elections.
In 2004, the polls predicated that the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA, which was relying on the ‘India shining’ campaign, would win big.
However, the Congress made a huge comeback in 2004.
In 2009, the exit polls predicted the UPA would get the most seats, but that the result would be a hung Parliament.
The Congress-led coalition defied the odds yet again with the Grand Old Party itself getting 200 seats.
In 2014, all the exit polls favoured the BJP-led NDA under Narendra Modi.
For NDA
The News24-Chanakya poll predicted that the NDA would nab 340 seats, while the India Today-Cicero poll gave the coalition 272 seats. The CNN-IBN-CSDS said the alliance would win 280 seats, while the Times Now poll gave the NDA.
The ABP News-Nielsen predicted 274 seats for the NDA, while the NDTV-Hansa Research estimated 279 seats for the NDA.
For UPA
For the UPA, the India Today-Cicero pollster predicted 115 seats, while News 24-Chanakya estimated 101 seats. The CNN-IBN-CSDS gave the alliance 97 seats, while Times Now projected 148 seats.
Advertisement The ABP News-Nielsen said the UPA would win 97 seats, while NDTV-Hansa Research said the alliance would net 103 seats.
Pollsters seemed to underestimate the hunger for change in the public mind as well as the sheer scale of the NDA’s victory and the UPA’s defeat.
Of all the pollsters, the News24-Chanakya was most on the money.
Advertisement The NDA would go on to win a massive 336 seats with the BJP itself crossing the half-way mark in Parliament and netting 282 seats.
The UPA, on the other hand, would be reduced to just 60 seats with the Congress winning 44 seats by its lonesome.
2019 polls
In 2019, most pollsters predicted that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA government would return – albeit with a reduced margin.
For NDA
The India Today-Axis pollster predicted that the NDA would win between 339 and 365 seats, while the News 24-Today’s Chanakya gave the alliance 350 seats.
The News18-IPSOS poll said the NDA would net 336 seats, while Times Now-VMR predicted 306 seats for the NDA.
The India TV-CNX pollster estimated 300 seats for the alliance, while the Sudarshan News poll gave the NDA 305 seats.
Advertisement For UPA
Meanwhile, for the UPA, the India Today-Axi poll predicted between 77 and 108 seats, while the News 24-Today’s Chanakya estimated 95 seats.
The News18-IPSOS poll said the UPA would win 82 seats, while the Times Now-VMR poll gave the alliance 132 seats.
The India TV-CNX predicted 120 seats for the UPA, while Sudarshan News estimated the alliance would net 124 seats.
The India Today-Axis gave the UPA between 77 and 108 seats, while News 24-Today’s Chanakya predicted 95 seats.
Most of the pollsters yet again failed to gauge the popularity of the BJP-led NDA.
Advertisement The NDA, incredibly, ended up bettering its 2014 tally in a resounding vote of confidence in Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The alliance won 352 seats with the BJP itself winning 303 seats.
Meanwhile, the Congress-led UPA expanded its tally to 91 seats with the grand old party winning 52 seats – but it was nothing to write home about.
The News 24-Today’s Chanakya was yet again the most accurate pollster.
Are exit polls accurate?
Not necessarily.
As noted above, pollsters have been off the mark with remarkable frequency in at least four recent Lok Sabha elections including 2004 and 2009.
Exit polls are also often condemned for being biased, relying on skewed data or improper sample size, and being sponsored or politically motivated, Business Standard.
The Economic Times quoted TK Arun as saying, “Exit polls are tricky in India. Indians are prudent people. Why would they tell a pollster anything other than what they figure out the pollster wants to hear? Suppose he voted Congress, and says so to the pollster, the BJP wins the election and extracts from pollsters details of all those who said they voted Congress, what mayhem might not follow? Why take the risk? Indians can be rational when the issue at stake is lack of faith as well.”
In short, exit polls can be hazardous to a political junkie’s health.

As the lengthy 44-day electoral process ends, attention will shift to exit polls, which are expected to provide insights into the election outcomes starting from 6:30 pm on 1 June.
Exit polls are crucial for gauging the mood of the electorate and predicting the likely winners before the official results are declared. However, their accuracy and methodology are often subjects of debate and scrutiny.
Advertisement What is the methodology behind exit polls?
Exit polls are conducted by surveying voters immediately after they cast their votes. This method contrasts with opinion polls, which are conducted before the elections to gather voters&rsquo; views on various issues and candidates. Exit polls aim to provide a snapshot of voting trends, influenced by various factors such as issues, personalities, and party loyalties.
The methodology of exit polls involves interviewing voters outside polling stations using a structured questionnaire. This approach relies on the voters&rsquo; recent experiences, increasing the likelihood of obtaining accurate responses.

AP The data collected is then analysed to estimate vote shares and predict seat outcomes. These polls are typically conducted by private firms or media organisations rather than government agencies.
How has technology changed conducting exit polls?
Technological advancements have significantly influenced the conduct of exit polls. Techniques such as call-backs to respondents, images of interviews being conducted, phone calls from the field, and WhatsApp groups have enhanced data collection and analysis.
Despite these advancements, ensuring the accuracy of predictions remains challenging due to the complex and diverse nature of the Indian electorate.

The Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) emphasises the importance of representative samples in ensuring accurate predictions. A large sample size is crucial, but the representativeness of the sample is equally important.

Estimating vote shares and predicting seat outcomes are the primary challenges in conducting exit polls. The swing model, which relies on past election results, is influenced by various factors such as geographic location, caste, religion, and economic class.
Changes in political alliances between elections can also affect predictions. The prediction process is labour-intensive and time-consuming, as it involves making estimates for each seat.

AP The complexity of swings increases with the number of political players. For example, the BJP and JD(U) alliance in Bihar poses a challenge for the swing model. Over- or under-representation of diverse voter sections can impact the accuracy of estimates.
Advertisement How accurate are exit polls?
The accuracy of exit polls depends on various factors beyond sample size. The representativeness of the sample, the methodology used, and the ability to account for diverse voter profiles are critical. Some agencies rely on innovative methods, such as eliminating certain constituencies from the poll, to improve accuracy.

Their predictions have varied in accuracy, highlighting the complexities involved in electoral predictions.
Have exit polls ever got it wrong?
Historically, exit polls have had mixed accuracy. Some notable instances where exit polls diverged significantly from actual results include:
Advertisement 2004 Lok Sabha Elections: Exit polls predicted a majority for the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA government. However, the actual results saw the NDA falling short of expectations.
Delhi Assembly Elections 2015: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) secured a sweeping victory with 67 out of 70 seats, which was underestimated by exit polls.
Bihar Assembly Elections 2015: Exit polls predicted a close race, but the RJD-JDU-Congress coalition won decisively.
UP Assembly Elections 2017: Despite exit polls predicting a hung assembly, the BJP won over 300 seats.
2014 Lok Sabha Elections: Exit polls did not foresee the BJP achieving an outright majority, which it did by crossing the 272-mark on its own.
In India, exit polls are regulated under Section 126A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. This section prohibits the conduct and publication of exit polls during the polling period to avoid influencing voters.

Why are exit polls released after all votes are cast? Why are they relevant?,https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-are-exit-polls-released-after-all-votes-are-cast-why-are-they-relevant-13776094.html,Exit polls are essentially quick interviews with voters.

They are aimed at predicting which party is likely to come to power,"The Election Commission has ordered that no exit polls be conducted prior to 6.30 pm on 1 June. The seventh and final phase of the Lok Sabha polls is underway with 57 parliamentary constituencies set to cast their vote across eight states and union territories.
The counting for the Lok Sabha Elections 2024 will take place on 4 June.
But what do we know about exit polls? What is their history? Why are they relevant? And what about their rules?

What are they?
Exit polls are essentially quick interviews with voters.
They are usually conducted right after voters exit the polls on voting day – as opposed to opinion polls which are conducted beforehand.
The idea behind them is to offer a snapshot of the voters’ concerns. They are aimed at predicting which party is likely to come to power.
Several news channels and agencies in India conduct exit polls – with varying degrees of success.
As per Business Standard, their accuracy depends on a slew of factors including structured questionnaires, in-person or telephonic interviews of random people for fairness, sample size, demographic representation, data compilation, and count method.
The first exit poll was conducted in 1957 by the Indian Institute of Public Opinion.
The group conducted an exit poll during the second Lok Sabha elections.
As per Hindustan Times, it was the Delhi-based Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) that pioneered in the 1960s.
But it was another two decades before exit polls began being taken seriously in the media.
This is when psephologist Prannoy Roy teamed up with David Butler.
Advertisement Roy, Butler and Ashok Lahiri would go on to publish a landmark book The Compendium of Indian Elections.
State-run Doordarshan asking the CSDS to conduct a countrywide exit poll in 1996 also brought exit polls further into the mainstream.
“Without a structured questionnaire, the data can neither be collected coherently nor be analysed systematically to arrive at vote share estimates,” Indian Express quoted Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) director Sanjay Kumar as saying.
What are the rules for exit polls?
Exit polls are governed by The Representation of People Act, 1951.
Section 126 A of the act restricts publication and dissemination of exit polls results.
Advertisement Exit polls are usually conducted right after voters exit the polls on voting day – as opposed to opinion polls which are conducted beforehand. PTI It states, “No person shall conduct any exit poll and publish or publicise by means of the print or electronic media or disseminate in any other manner, whatsoever, the result of any exit poll during such period, as may be notified by the Election Commission in this regard.”
It adds that in case of a general election, the period may commence from the beginning of the hours fixed for the poll on the first day and continue till half an hour after the closing of the poll in all the States and Union territories.
According to Business Standard, this is done so that exit polls don’t influence voters or voting patterns.
Advertisement Those who violate this provision can be sentenced to a prison term of up to two years, a fine or both.
The Election Commission first issued guidelines on exit polls in 1998. The EC under Article 324 of the Constitution barred newspapers and television news channels from publishing or broadcasting results of opinion and exit polls between 5 pm on 14 February 1998 and 5 pm on 7 March 1998. The first phase in that year’s general elections began on 16 February 1998, and the final phase began on 7 March.
As per Economic Times, the EC in 2022 said news broadcasters must not air any final, formal and definite results &ldquo;until such results are formally announced by the Election Commission of India, unless such results are carried with clear disclaimer that they are unofficial or incomplete or partial results or projections which should not be taken as final results.&rdquo;
Advertisement Why are exit polls relevant?
Because people want to know which party and candidates are likely to win &ndash; and quickly.
However, critics say that they are often left wanting when it comes to accuracy.
According to Business Standard, exit polls are also often condemned for being biased, relying on skewed data or improper sample size, and being sponsored or politically motivated. The Economic Times quoted TK Arun as saying, &ldquo;Exit polls are tricky in India. Indians are prudent people. Why would they tell a pollster anything other than what they figure out the pollster wants to hear? Suppose he voted Congress, and says so to the pollster, the BJP wins the election and extracts from pollsters details of all those who said they voted Congress, what mayhem might not follow? Why take the risk? Indians can be rational when the issue at stake is lack of faith as well.&rdquo;
In the past, exit polls have had both hits and misses galore.
According to Hindustan Times, except for the 1998 and 2014 polls, at least four Lok Sabha polls have gotten it badly wrong.
This includes two back-to-back predictions in 2004 and 2009.
The 2004 exit polls in particular were a massive failure with the pollsters completely missing the Congress coming back to power as the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA with its ‘India Shining’ slogan lost its majority.
All exit polls predicted a win for the BJP.
Again in 2009, while most pollsters gave the edge to the UPA, they completely missed a huge swing in its favour.
The UPA added 40 more seats to its tally.
A man looks at a television screen showing exit poll results after the last phase of the general election in Ahmedabad on 19 May 2019. File photo/Reuters In 2014, the BJP won over 330 seats.
While most pollsters said then prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi and the BJP-led NDA would cross the 272 mark, almost none of them forecast the decisive performance.
It was only pollster Chanakya, who predicted 340 seats for the NDA, that came close to getting it spot on.
In 2019, most pollsters predicted that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA government would return &ndash; albeit with a reduced margin compared to the previous election. Of course, we know that the pollsters yet again underestimated the strength of the BJP-led NDA, which would nab 353 seats.

"Predictions, predilections, and Indian general elections",https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/predictions-predilections-and-indian-general-elections-13775669.html,Election predictions are notoriously hard due to the changing nature of the parameters,"Predictions are awfully difficult, even with the reassuring crunch of numbers! And yet, they are our fatal predilection, whether the challenge is for our pleasure or for that of others. Be it the stock market, astrology, or gambling, our insatiable curiosity for the mysterious and unknown is probably what propels such abandonment.
Take the ongoing Lok Sabha polls, going on for perhaps too long now, and the concomitant barrage of prophecies from TV channels, from YouTube “influenczars” and from downright bored individuals, all of whom shoot off their incendiary numbers into the tinder of social media. These soothsayers speak from relative ignorance and mostly from a fascination for a particular party, be they pidis or bhakts.They speak with the confidence that they can actually fool all the people all the time, with Abraham Lincoln being the ultimate fool, poor man. What is most horrendous is that all of them have declared random numbers like 180, 200, 250, 272, 303, 320, 362, 370, and the ace of spades, 400, long before all the votes have come in. This is why I liken election predictions in India to gambling. It is matka guessing in a satta bazar. Parrot talk, or tarot talk, it leads to no concrete outcome. It does not affect the choices made by the voters, choices one suspects were cast in stone, long before the elections were even announced. And yet, these delirious djinns persist, as their minds are made up too. The happy side to this sad fantasy is that it is time-bound, and we can all reclaim our normal lives on June 4.
Advertisement Lighter comments aside, there is a more serious side to prediction, based on the assumption that future events are influenced to some or a greater extent by what has happened before. History is our greatest teacher. The art and science of good prediction lie in identifying which past (or present) event will likely influence an event to come. Let us take the Indian monsoon, an annual event of major economic importance to our nation, and one that has just begun this year. It would help the government enormously if it knew a few months in advance if the monsoon were to be normal, below average, or will punch above its weight.
At present, the Indian monsoon is predicted using a combination of atmospheric models, sea surface temperature analysis, historical data, and satellite observations. Key factors include the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, the Indian Ocean Dipole, and wind patterns. Advanced computational models simulate these variables to forecast rainfall and monsoon onset accurately. However, there are totally different methods of monsoon prediction that would not be considered ‘scientific’ by western definition, but are yet chillingly accurate. Traditionally, some Indian communities predict the monsoon by observing the nesting behaviour of certain birds, like the Indian weaver bird (Baya Weaver). It is believed that if these birds build their nests on higher branches, a heavier monsoon will ensue. Conversely, lower nests indicate lighter rainfall. This method relies on the birds&rsquo; instinctive response to environmental cues, and seems to be largely reliable. Nature lovers might like to correlate this occurrence with the Japanese kō or 72 micro-seasons, for further poetic justification.
Advertisement Prediction is a key aspect of science, and the smaller the number of known events, phenomena, and parameters used to predict a large number of future events accurately, the better the value of the prediction. At the risk of introducing an equation in this column, one can say the value of a prediction, V = (N/n) – 1, where one is able to correctly predict N outcomes with n parameters. According to this equation, the value of a prediction is zero if one needs n parameters to predict N outcomes.
Let’s apply this equation to the present Lok Sabha election. We could say that N = 543, in other words, we want to correctly predict the results from 543 constituencies. How many parameters would we need, or what is the value of n, for a good prediction? What our present-day pollsters are doing, in trying to improve the accuracy of their guesses, is to increase the number of parameters to absurd levels. They ask whether all the Muslim women in Kishanganj will vote like their menfolk, whether the hot summer days in Ramagundam will harm voting, or whether all the Gounders in Kovai will stay loyal to the AIADMK. The problem with such micro-parameters is that they cannot be quantified properly. Informal surveys on the ground may not be the answer because all respondents may not answer truthfully. We see ludicrous statements from politicians—some say that low turnouts hurt the BJP, while others say that low turnouts hurt the Congress. Others say that a low or high turnout may help or hurt a party, depending on the state. Still others say that whatever happens, Congress is winning. The problem with any or all of this is that none of it can be either proven or disproven—this makes it non-scientific. The reader will appreciate that as n increases with all these unprovable parameters, the value of the prediction quickly goes to zero. It is easier to say that there is only one parameter in this election, and that is the prime minister himself. Applying the equation, the value of my prediction is (543/1) – 1 = 542, which in practical terms means a sizable majority for the BJP. I think I’m doing pretty well for myself with this prediction. June 4 will tell.
Advertisement What I would have liked to see, and what seems missing, is a more accurate assessment of ‘swing’ constituencies in bellwether states. No expert needs to predict that the BJP will win in Gandhinagar or that it will lose in South Kolkata. On the other hand, if the BJP were to win in Thiruvananthapuram, Bengaluru Rural, Hyderabad, or Central Chennai, this would signify that winds of change are blowing across the country. The very high voter turnout in Baramulla is another pointer. An ability to extrapolate from this to an accurate prediction about the Kashmir Valley in particular and the country in general, is what is missing. Once again, what I would like to see on June 4 is how soon any particular TV channel is able to call the election, say by 9, 10, or 11 am? The sooner it is able to do this, the better its reports will be and the less fluff and bluff.
Advertisement Election predictions are notoriously hard due to the changing nature of the parameters, something we do not usually see in science. The Truman-Dewey US presidential election of 1945, was made memorable by the photograph of the victor, Harry Truman, brandishing a copy of the Chicago Tribune that screamed the wrong headline, “Dewey defeats Truman”. So close was the vote. At the end of World War II, the UK voted against Winston Churchill, their doughty PM, who had saved them from Nazi tyranny. He was hustled out of office when the Labour Party won by a substantial majority. Can we ever imagine a similar situation in India? And yet, some of our own elections have indeed yielded surprising results, and one recollects 1971, 1977, and 2019, when the decisiveness of the mandate was quite something else.

Before the sixth and seventh phases on 25 May and 1 June, the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) has carried out an analysis, which shows that 1,644 of the 8,337 candidates contesting in the ongoing Lok Sabha elections have criminal cases registered against them.
Of these candidates, 1,188 face serious criminal charges, including allegations of murder, attempted murder, crimes against women, and hate speech.
Advertisement Here is a phase-by-phase analysis.
Phase 1: 19 April
In phase 1, out of 1,618 candidates analysed, 252 have criminal cases and 161 serious criminal cases.
According to the ADR, seven candidates face murder charges, while 19 are involved in attempted murder cases. Eighteen candidates have declared cases of crimes against women in their affidavits, with one facing a rape charge under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

Twenty-five candidates have declared cases related to crimes against women, with one facing rape charges under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The analysis revealed that twenty-one candidates have been linked to cases of hate speech.
It also revealed that 52 per cent of the 87 seats in the second phase of seven-phase elections are &lsquo;red alert&rsquo; constituencies. ‘Red alert’ constituencies are those where three or more candidates have declared criminal cases in their affidavits.
Phase 3: 7 May
In phase 3, out of 1,352 candidates, 244 have criminal cases and 172 serious criminal cases, 18 per cent of the total candidates in the fray.

This was also going to be the biggest election in the world’s biggest democracy. With over 900 million broadband subscribers, the Indian voter is more plugged into the commentary of the voting analysis, trends and outcomes.
The cacophony of election analysis is hardwired into the heads of Indian citizens through their phones and devices, their choices dictated by opinions and beliefs, which in turn has been an outcome of results seen in the last five years. Yet, when I went to cast my vote this Monday, the booth-level machinery was so well-oiled and efficient that beyond the cacophony of election sloganeering and digital pyrotechnics, the unassuming power of silent citizens dutifully stepping up to vote on their appointed day, sans drama or hyperbole, held up a useful guide for the rest of the world to emulate.
Advertisement India, the world’s most populous democracy, is currently holding its general election over a seven-phase period that continues for seven weeks. Indians can vote between 19 April and 1 June, with the results set to be declared on 4 June.
The World Decides in 2024
Over fifty elections take place in 2024, including some of the most impacting ones such as the US, Russia, India, Taiwan. Fifty-one per cent of the world will either have a new dispensation or continue with the existing one. As elections take place across the world, the festival of democracy in India is expected to be among the keenly contested, fair and well organised ones in the world.
These elections have also proved that India sets consistent standards in choosing their leaders, disproving a biased opinion about democracy and elections that certain western thinking has held towards India. Using a template of a fairness score to evaluate the independence of elections in countries, as a well-known western publication recently did, reduces the process of choices in elections to a rating number which can both end up being biased and patronising, and is dictated by a long-held expectation that Indian polls are simultaneously cantankerous and exotic — a work in progress democracy that promises to be civilised but is never one. It also served to quietly aid a narrative that the democratic processes in the west are superior.
Advertisement Why India’s Free Elections Trumps West’s Bias
Take for instance, the freedom and fairness score accorded to India’s elections, which is 0.53 and compare it to the other nations in their leadup to the elections. Mexico is a country heading for elections this year. In this election cycle, 30 candidates have already been assassinated, according to data from the research firm Laboratorio Electoral. In 2021, 30 candidates were killed while in 2018, the elections saw 24 killings. These elections are expected to be among the most violent. According to western pundits, Mexico has a freedom and fairness score of 0.75 in the conduct of elections, which indicates the elections are more ‘just and fair’ than in India. Parts of western media has been unduly harsh on India, rating its fairness score of elections at 0.53.
Advertisement In Indonesia, the electoral process is still dominated by corrupt or influential leaders who grew powerful during the authoritarian rule of Suharto. Democracy is new, and power oscillated between influential stakeholders, till Joko Widodo, an outsider, broke the stranglehold. Thereafter, a general took over as President — one the west has accused of human rights abuses. Interestingly, Indonesia’s freedom and fairness score stands at 0.68, higher than India. Which means that the credibility of Indian elections is just about better than the banana republics — an assumption that betrays the negative bias of such studies.
The US, rated high in freedom and fairness index by the publication, struggled under serious allegations of tampering and influence by Russia and the subsequent response of Trump supporters laying siege in Washington DC after losing the elections indicated a democracy that was functional but not civilised. On the other hand, far from the history of some of the nations, who have either embraced dysfunctional democracy along the way or seem to be falling by the wayside in terms of their law and order situation in the lead up to the elections, India has maintained an enviable record of holding free and fair elections over seven decades.
Advertisement The Decisive Indian Vote
From the general election held in 1951-52 in which 17.5 crore Indians, voted in the elections to the 18th Lok Sabha that are under way, the process has evolved and matured along with Indian democracy over the decades. So have the voters graduated, from being largely illiterate to being well informed and technically savvy while making choices.
The CEC explained why the voluntary nature of casting votes means that the ECI operates ‘in an entirely persuasive space, inviting the citizens to volunteer to become part of the electoral roll and, thereafter, through systematic voter awareness programmes, motivates them to exercise their franchise.’ There is a high elector to population ratio which underpins the discipline, patience and belief that Indian voters have demonstrated in executing the process. The power of Indian elections demonstrates a growing, emerging India that is willing and ready to show how democracy is a proven political system in this world. Take for instance the example of Jammu and Kashmir.
Advertisement Since 1989, all earlier elections in the region had been plagued by violence and a tendence towards anarchy, influenced by separatist parties. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Anantnag, Srinagar and Baramulla — the Lok Sabha seats — recorded dismal attendance.
Baramulla recorded 46 per cent voting in 1996. Thereafter it has struggled to have voters on election days. Twenty-eight years later, 59 per cent of Baramulla showed up to vote on polling day, breaking the previous record.
This time, local political leaders have addressed large crowds who are keen to be a part of the time-tested process of democracy and express their opinions at the poll booths, unlike earlier times when boycotts dominated Kashmiri elections and the turnout, cowed down by the gun, often struggled to crawl out of single digit percentage attendance.
The resolve to bring Kashmir out of a rut of decades-old militancy by taking the gun out of the equation has helped locals trust the power of the ballot in making lives better instead of being ruled by fear of militancy. There is a growing curiosity about the choices available in a democracy through the power of the ballot, which many people in the state now see value in, unlike across the border where democracy is in shambles and offers no choices.
Younger India: 18 Million First-Time Voters
One of the key aspects in these elections is the addition of over 2-crore young first time voters. These voters, in each successive edition, are going to boost a voting population that consumes digital information and has a strong sense of independent opinion. A keen interest among young voters has led to parties canvassing through digital platforms. An increasingly politically conscious, intelligent but less patient voter base has meant that parties have had to address more matured issues – which also tells us how India has travelled a fair distance from the days when Garibi Hatao was a dominating slogan.
The voter turnout, lower in the early stages, yet reflects an involved participation of its citizens across the country. In a country where different belief systems have held sway, the one common space where India comes together as a country is its general election. Which is why, an election season resembles a festival of choices rather than a mere mechanical process of choosing.
India Votes for the World to Emulate
In the previous national edition in 2019, the Election Commission confirmed a 67 per cent turnout. The Americans were marginally higher in the same period while voting in their elections. The Indian elections have also been among the most expensive elections, in which political parties spent more than 7 billion in 2019, higher than the spends in the US elections in that period. Not only are the Indian general elections the largest poll show on earth — they are also the most intensely contested and certainly, sets the bar for America to follow this November.
While wars and conflicts singe the world in most parts and certain nations have gone berserk losing their way while making choices, India proves yet again that this election festival of citizens is not only the biggest but also the most civilised and sane process on earth.

"Busy dousing fire on Swati Maliwal 'assault' row, AAP loses a week of Kejriwal's freedom and fought against itself than rivals",https://www.firstpost.com/india/busy-dousing-fire-on-swati-maliwal-assault-row-aap-loses-a-week-of-kejriwals-freedom-and-fought-against-itself-than-rivals-13772369.html,"Amid the escalating blame game, the focus abruptly moved from Arvind Kejriwal to Swati Maliwal and the internal feud between Maliwal and other AAP members overshadowed Kejriwal&rsquo;s continuous attacks on the prime minister and the BJP","When the Supreme Court granted interim bail to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on 10 May until 2 June, the AAP leader had a clear agenda ahead. Arrested on 21 March by the Enforcement Directorate in the liquor policy case, Kejriwal now had 21 days to capitalise on his temporary release. His primary focus would have been to generate publicity for himself and the AAP by intensifying his criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP.
Advertisement The Maliwal incident: A shift in focus
This situation progressed smoothly until the Swati Maliwal incident on 13 May. On that day, AAP Rajya Sabha MP Swati Maliwal accused Bibhav Kumar, a member of Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal&rsquo;s personal staff of misconduct. Following her allegations, the Delhi Police arrested Kejriwal&rsquo;s private assistant Bibhav Kumar, igniting a dual conflict: AAP versus BJP and Swati Maliwal versus the rest of AAP.
Amid the escalating blame game, two significant shifts occurred. First, the focus abruptly moved from Arvind Kejriwal to Swati Maliwal. Second, the internal feud between Maliwal and other AAP members overshadowed Kejriwal&rsquo;s continuous attacks on the prime minister and the BJP.
Significantly, this incident consumed a crucial portion of Kejriwal&rsquo;s 21 days of freedom with an entire week diverted to the Maliwal controversy.
Strategic reorientation
Regardless of whether AAP inadvertently fell into a trap or recognised the situation belatedly, Kejriwal understood the pressing need to redirect attention back to himself. He needed to refocus the battle onto BJP territory and distance the party from the Maliwal incident. Whether it was genuine support for his long-time aide Kumar or a strategy to revitalise AAP, the Delhi chief minister knew that a significant move was necessary to reclaim the spotlight.
What better way to do it than challenge Prime Minister Modi to arrest all AAP leaders as he announced on Saturday that he would march to BJP headquarters in Delhi on Sunday at noon accompanied by all the prominent leaders of his party. More the chaos better the publicity.
Advertisement Kejriwal alleged that the BJP was trying to completely destroy AAP through Operation Jhadu. He shared that people who were familiar with both the BJP and him had informed him that Prime Minister Modi acknowledged AAP&rsquo;s growing influence and the global discussion around their work. Kejriwal said that the BJP saw AAP as a potential tough challenger in several states and wanted to eliminate them. He made these statements while addressing the press at the party office on Sunday.
Importance of Delhi for AAP
Voting for all seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi is scheduled for 25 May as part of Phase 6 of the polling.
Advertisement Delhi is of paramount importance to the AAP for several reasons. It is the party&rsquo;s primary base and stronghold where it was founded and first achieved significant political success by winning the Delhi Legislative Assembly elections in 2013. Maintaining control over Delhi is essential for AAP&rsquo;s political legitimacy and influence. Furthermore, Delhi serves as a showcase for AAP&rsquo;s governance model and policies.
AAP finds itself grappling with the challenge of maintaining a focussed engagement with its diverse electorate in Delhi, which encompasses various socioeconomic groups. Amid its efforts to highlight flagship programmes such as mohalla clinics, subsidised electricity and its work in government schools, the controversy surrounding Maliwal has diverted public attention from these areas which AAP would have wanted to bring in front of the voters.
Advertisement Whether the Maliwal incident is indeed a premeditated attack on AAP as the party alleges or simply a coincidence only time will reveal. However, there is no doubt that it has placed AAP in a defensive position precisely when it was gearing up for a strong offensive. Whether it&rsquo;s a calculated move by a political mastermind or just an unfortunate stroke of fate remains uncertain for now.

How Swati Maliwal row is disrupting Arvind Kejriwal’s campaign for Lok Sabha polls,https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/swati-maliwal-row-arvind-kejriwal-13772041.html,"While Arvind Kejriwal&rsquo;s release from jail to campaign for the Lok Sabha polls came as a big relief to the AAP and the Opposition, the Swati Maliwal controversy has cast a pall over proceedings. While the Delhi chief minister has remained mum over the matter, the party has claimed that there is a &lsquo;BJP conspiracy&rsquo; to frame him","Arvind Kejriwal must have felt great relief when he was granted bail by the Supreme Court.
The apex court granted the Delhi chief minister bail in the alleged money laundering case in order to campaign for the Lok Sabha polls.
But the controversy over Swati Maliwal has dogged Kejriwal at every step.
Maliwal, the AAP&rsquo;s Rajya Sabha MP, filed an FIR on Thursday accusing the Delhi chief minister&rsquo;s aide Bibhav Kumar of assaulting her. Advertisement The AAP has alleged a conspiracy is being hatched against Kejriwal, while the BJP has demanded stringent action against the accused.
Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at how the row has disrupted his campaign:
Kejriwal&rsquo;s release from jail was a big boost to the party and the Opposition.
The Times of India quoted Sandeep Pathak, a close aide of Kejriwal who is overseeing the AAP Lok Sabha campaign, as saying the development breathed fresh life into the party.
&ldquo;With him, the cadre feels happier, much more positive, much more charged. That’s one aspect of it. The other is that the BJP thought that they would get Kejriwal arrested and then start breaking up the AAP in Delhi and Punjab. But they miserably failed,&rdquo; the AAP Rajya Sabha MP said.
But Maliwal&rsquo;s accusations have now cast a pall over proceedings.
&ldquo;While the whole truth is not out yet, all is certainly not well inside the AAP. There have been reports of differences between Kejriwal and Maliwal for some time. There are claims that Kejriwal was not happy with Maliwal&rsquo;s absence from Delhi before and after his arrest as well as her relative silence on his arrest. Maliwal, however, was reportedly visiting her sister in the US,&rdquo; the piece stated.
It noted that if Kejriwal is sent to jail again for a long time, the party is likely to fracture. But if he is granted regular bail, he will likely be able to keep his team together.
&ldquo;What was supposed to be a few weeks of respite for Kejriwal are proving to be a testing period. His attention will now be divided between the election campaign and the party affairs,&rdquo; the piece noted.
Advertisement On Wednesday some people also raised slogans during Kejriwal&rsquo;s road show in Chandni Chowk against Kumar, as per The Times of India.
&lsquo;Slapped, hit in stomach&rsquo;
Maliwal in her FIR filed Thursday claimed she was &ldquo;slapped, hit in the stomach and kicked&rdquo; by Kumar.
The FIR was registered after Maliwal&rsquo;s statement was recorded by a two-member team led by Additional Commissioner of Police P.S. Kushwaha.
The team was at Maliwal&rsquo;s residence in central Delhi for nearly four and a half hours.
AAP Rajya Sabha MP Swati Maliwal has accused Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal&rsquo;s aide of assault. PTI File Photo Maliwal claimed she ran out of the CM&rsquo;s residence and called the police immediately after the incident.
Kejriwal was present at his residence when the incident took place, she added.
Advertisement Maliwal broke down several times while giving the statement and sought strict action against Kumar.
The AAP MP on Thursday underwent medical check-up at All India Institute of Medical Sciences.
Kejriwal evades question, BJP attacks
Adding fuel to the fire, Kejriwal on Wednesday did not address Maliwal&rsquo;s allegations during a press conference.
Kejriwal, flanked by Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav and AAP Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh, evaded a question on the subject.
Singh, however, said his party has already made its stand clear on the issue.
#WATCH | Lucknow, UP: On AAP Rajya Sabha MP Swati Maliwal&#39;s assault case, AAP MP Sanjay Singh says &quot;The entire country was in pain after seeing what happened in Manipur but PM Modi was silent on the issue.

&mdash; ANI (@ANI) May 16, 2024 Advertisement Singh, who had met Maliwal at her residence on Wednesday, said, &ldquo;The AAP is our family. Party has made its view clear.&rdquo;
He also targeted the BJP government at the Centre by raising the issue of a Manipuri woman being paraded naked, the Prajwal Revanna sex scandal and Maliwal being &ldquo;beaten up&rdquo; by police during protests by wrestlers when she was the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) chief.
Advertisement &ldquo;I want that BJP and PM should also answer on the issues I have kept before you. He (PM) should answer on the issue of Swati Maliwal, who was dragged and beaten when she went to seek justice for the female wrestlers. I just want to say don&rsquo;t play political games on the issues,&rdquo; he said.
Yadav then took the microphone and said &ldquo;there are more important things than that&rdquo;.
Then, unfolding a piece of paper, he added, &ldquo;BJP people are not with anyone, it is a &lsquo;gang&rsquo; that lodges false cases&rdquo;.
Singh at a press conference on Tuesday had accepted that Kumar had &ldquo;misbehaved&rdquo; with Maliwal.
He also labelled the incident &lsquo;highly condemnable&rsquo;, as per The Times of India.
BJP national spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia claimed that Kejriwal is the main &ldquo;criminal&rdquo; in the complaint that his aide Kumar had physically attacked Maliwal at the chief minister&rsquo;s residence, as he cited the telephone call she had made to the Delhi Police to report the matter.
&ldquo;His (Kejriwal) silence speaks a lot. Out of jail, he is more a &lsquo;goonda&rsquo; than a chief minister,&rdquo; he told reporters, noting that Kumar was seen with the chief minister in Lucknow.
Stringent action should be taken against the accused in the case, he said.
Kumar, he noted, was photographed with Kejriwal during his visit to Lucknow.
On Friday, the Delhi BJP Mahila Morcha members staged a protest near Kejriwal&rsquo;s residence.
Led by Mahila Morcha president Richa Pandey Mishra, the protesters, who were carrying bangles, demanded Kejriwal&rsquo;s resignation.
Mishra said the Mahila Morcha wanted to hand over the bangles to Kejriwal for keeping mum over the incident with Maliwal that occurred at his official residence.
“Arvind Kejriwal should be ashamed. He should resign from his post and apologise to the country. Swati Maliwal should get justice,&quot; a Mahila Morcha member told PTI.
The Mahila Morcha of the Delhi BJP also extended support to Maliwal, writing a letter to her saying the incident was a matter of honour of women in the country.
A team of the Delhi Police also turned up at Kejriwal&rsquo;s residence on Friday, as per India Today.
&lsquo;BJP conspiracy to frame Kejirwal&rsquo;
Meanwhile, the AAP has claimed the case is a &lsquo;BJP conspiracy to frame Kejriwal.&rsquo;
Senior AAP leader Atishi at a press conference said, &ldquo;Today a video has surfaced that has exposed the lie of Maliwal. In her FIR, she has said she was brutally assaulted and she was in pain, and buttons of her shirt were torn. A video that has surfaced shows an entirely different reality.&rdquo;
Atishi said the video shows Maliwal &ldquo;comfortably sitting in the drawing room&rdquo; and &ldquo;threatening the security staff&rdquo;, and that &ldquo;her clothes were not torn&rdquo;.
&ldquo;The video shows her threatening Kumar. The charges levelled by Maliwal are baseless. Maliwal insisted on meeting Kejriwal. She is Rajya Sabha MP and she should know that the CM has a busy schedule. Kumar told her that the chief minister is busy and unable to meet her. She shouted at him, pushed him and tried to enter the residential portion of the CM House,&rdquo; she claimed.
&ldquo;The whole incident proves that it was a BJP conspiracy and Swati Maliwal was made its face to frame Kejriwal,&rdquo; she alleged.
Asked about Singh accepting misbehaviour with Maliwal, Atishi said, &ldquo;AAP MP Sanjay Singh met Maliwal and he had only her version. But now this video has brought out the truth.&rdquo;

Here&rsquo;s what the News18 exit poll has predicted for the NDA and the INDI Alliance in some of the big states,"The voting for the Lok Sabha elections has come to an end and it’s been a lengthy process — seven long phases spread over six weeks. Now, it’s time to shift attention to the results. Before the results are announced on 4 June, here’s what the exit polls reveal.
Most exit polls are predicting a return of the Narendra Modi-led NDA government, winning over 350 seats, with the Opposition’s INDI Alliance managing somewhere between 125 and 150. News18 conducted its own mega exit poll, according to which NDA has bagged 355-370 seats, while the INDI Alliance has won 125-140 seats.
Advertisement But how has the NDA fared against the INDI Alliance in each state? We break through the clutter and present the results of the News18 mega exit poll in quick, easy graphics.
NORTH
The NDA, as per News18&rsquo;s exit poll, will continue its dominance in the north. In Uttar Pradesh, the NDA is poised to win 68-71 of the 80 seats, while the INDI Alliance is predicted to win nine-12 seats.
In Bihar, the NDA, of which Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s JDU is a part, will be bagging 31-34 seats, while INDI Alliance is believed to get six-nine seats. Delhi and Haryana is all about the NDA once again.
SOUTH
In the South, it seems a Narendra Modi-led push has helped the BJP. Exit polls predict an improved performance of the BJP in the five southern states. It seems in Andhra Pradesh, the alliance with Chandrababu Naidu-led Telugu Desam Party has paid big dividends for the BJP, with the NDA emerging on top. In Telangana, the News18 exit poll gives BJP a big reason to smile, predicting the party to win seven-10 seats, compared to Congress’ five-eight.
Karnataka is also expected to vote overwhelmingly for the BJP, despite its preference for the Congress at the state level. In Tamil Nadu, the party is even expected to make a debut, securing between one-three seats, exit polls predict.
Advertisement The Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) is set to sweep Kerala once, while the BJP-led NDA will open its account in the southern state.
EAST
The News18 exit poll predicts that the BJP-led NDA will build on its 2019 performance in the east. In West Bengal, the BJP seems to be the biggest winner, with the Mamata Banerjee led TMC trailing behind. And in Assam, it&rsquo;s NDA all the way, predicted to win 10-13 seats.
Another big surprise is from the state of Odisha. The exit poll has predicted a clean sweep for the BJP. The poll predicts the BJP will win 13-15 seats, with the BJD to come in second with six-eight seats.
Advertisement WEST
In the West, the BJP-led NDA is predicted to be the big winner as per the exit poll. Gujarat is the big news here with the NDA set to be sweeping all 26 seats. Meanwhile, in Maharashtra, the NDA is predicted to win 32-35 seats, with the INDI Alliance winning 15-18 seats.
In Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, it&rsquo;s all about the NDA once again. The News18 exit poll predicts 26-29 seats for the NDA out of the 29 seats. In Rajasthan, the NDA is predicted to win 18-25 seats.

Now, with the counting of votes scheduled for 4 June, all eyes are on the exit polls. The exit polls have been released at 6.30 pm.
This is in line with the Section 126A of the Representation of the People’s Act, 1951, which states that exit polls can only be aired half an hour after the completion of the final phase of voting.
Advertisement But what did they predict in 2014 and 2019? And how accurate are exit polls really?
Let’s take a closer look:
2014
Going into 2014, pollsters were under some pressure.
After all, the exit polls had failed to get it right in back-to-back Lok Sabha elections.
In 2004, the polls predicated that the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA, which was relying on the ‘India shining’ campaign, would win big.
However, the Congress made a huge comeback in 2004.
In 2009, the exit polls predicted the UPA would get the most seats, but that the result would be a hung Parliament.
The Congress-led coalition defied the odds yet again with the Grand Old Party itself getting 200 seats.
In 2014, all the exit polls favoured the BJP-led NDA under Narendra Modi.
For NDA
The News24-Chanakya poll predicted that the NDA would nab 340 seats, while the India Today-Cicero poll gave the coalition 272 seats. The CNN-IBN-CSDS said the alliance would win 280 seats, while the Times Now poll gave the NDA.
The ABP News-Nielsen predicted 274 seats for the NDA, while the NDTV-Hansa Research estimated 279 seats for the NDA.
For UPA
For the UPA, the India Today-Cicero pollster predicted 115 seats, while News 24-Chanakya estimated 101 seats. The CNN-IBN-CSDS gave the alliance 97 seats, while Times Now projected 148 seats.
Advertisement The ABP News-Nielsen said the UPA would win 97 seats, while NDTV-Hansa Research said the alliance would net 103 seats.
Pollsters seemed to underestimate the hunger for change in the public mind as well as the sheer scale of the NDA’s victory and the UPA’s defeat.
Of all the pollsters, the News24-Chanakya was most on the money.
Advertisement The NDA would go on to win a massive 336 seats with the BJP itself crossing the half-way mark in Parliament and netting 282 seats.
The UPA, on the other hand, would be reduced to just 60 seats with the Congress winning 44 seats by its lonesome.
2019 polls
In 2019, most pollsters predicted that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA government would return – albeit with a reduced margin.
For NDA
The India Today-Axis pollster predicted that the NDA would win between 339 and 365 seats, while the News 24-Today’s Chanakya gave the alliance 350 seats.
The News18-IPSOS poll said the NDA would net 336 seats, while Times Now-VMR predicted 306 seats for the NDA.
The India TV-CNX pollster estimated 300 seats for the alliance, while the Sudarshan News poll gave the NDA 305 seats.
Advertisement For UPA
Meanwhile, for the UPA, the India Today-Axi poll predicted between 77 and 108 seats, while the News 24-Today’s Chanakya estimated 95 seats.
The News18-IPSOS poll said the UPA would win 82 seats, while the Times Now-VMR poll gave the alliance 132 seats.
The India TV-CNX predicted 120 seats for the UPA, while Sudarshan News estimated the alliance would net 124 seats.
The India Today-Axis gave the UPA between 77 and 108 seats, while News 24-Today’s Chanakya predicted 95 seats.
Most of the pollsters yet again failed to gauge the popularity of the BJP-led NDA.
Advertisement The NDA, incredibly, ended up bettering its 2014 tally in a resounding vote of confidence in Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The alliance won 352 seats with the BJP itself winning 303 seats.
Meanwhile, the Congress-led UPA expanded its tally to 91 seats with the grand old party winning 52 seats – but it was nothing to write home about.
The News 24-Today’s Chanakya was yet again the most accurate pollster.
Are exit polls accurate?
Not necessarily.
As noted above, pollsters have been off the mark with remarkable frequency in at least four recent Lok Sabha elections including 2004 and 2009.
Exit polls are also often condemned for being biased, relying on skewed data or improper sample size, and being sponsored or politically motivated, Business Standard.
The Economic Times quoted TK Arun as saying, “Exit polls are tricky in India. Indians are prudent people. Why would they tell a pollster anything other than what they figure out the pollster wants to hear? Suppose he voted Congress, and says so to the pollster, the BJP wins the election and extracts from pollsters details of all those who said they voted Congress, what mayhem might not follow? Why take the risk? Indians can be rational when the issue at stake is lack of faith as well.”
In short, exit polls can be hazardous to a political junkie’s health.

Following the 44-day electoral process, exit polls will commence, providing predictions on the likely victors and the extent of their triumph. What are these polls? Do they always get it right?","India&rsquo;s 18th Lok Sabha Elections, the largest democratic exercise on the planet, will conclude on 1 June, 2024 as the seventh phase comes to a close . As the lengthy 44-day electoral process ends, attention will shift to exit polls, which are expected to provide insights into the election outcomes starting from 6:30 pm on 1 June.
Exit polls are crucial for gauging the mood of the electorate and predicting the likely winners before the official results are declared. However, their accuracy and methodology are often subjects of debate and scrutiny.
Advertisement What is the methodology behind exit polls?
Exit polls are conducted by surveying voters immediately after they cast their votes. This method contrasts with opinion polls, which are conducted before the elections to gather voters&rsquo; views on various issues and candidates. Exit polls aim to provide a snapshot of voting trends, influenced by various factors such as issues, personalities, and party loyalties.
The methodology of exit polls involves interviewing voters outside polling stations using a structured questionnaire. This approach relies on the voters&rsquo; recent experiences, increasing the likelihood of obtaining accurate responses.

AP The data collected is then analysed to estimate vote shares and predict seat outcomes. These polls are typically conducted by private firms or media organisations rather than government agencies.
How has technology changed conducting exit polls?
Technological advancements have significantly influenced the conduct of exit polls. Techniques such as call-backs to respondents, images of interviews being conducted, phone calls from the field, and WhatsApp groups have enhanced data collection and analysis.
Despite these advancements, ensuring the accuracy of predictions remains challenging due to the complex and diverse nature of the Indian electorate.

AP Structured questionnaires are vital for coherent data collection and systematic analysis, reported Indian Express. The Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) emphasises the importance of representative samples in ensuring accurate predictions. A large sample size is crucial, but the representativeness of the sample is equally important.
Advertisement What challenges are faced while conducting exit polls?
Estimating vote shares and predicting seat outcomes are the primary challenges in conducting exit polls. The swing model, which relies on past election results, is influenced by various factors such as geographic location, caste, religion, and economic class.
Changes in political alliances between elections can also affect predictions. The prediction process is labour-intensive and time-consuming, as it involves making estimates for each seat.

AP The complexity of swings increases with the number of political players. For example, the BJP and JD(U) alliance in Bihar poses a challenge for the swing model. Over- or under-representation of diverse voter sections can impact the accuracy of estimates.
Advertisement How accurate are exit polls?
The accuracy of exit polls depends on various factors beyond sample size. The representativeness of the sample, the methodology used, and the ability to account for diverse voter profiles are critical. Some agencies rely on innovative methods, such as eliminating certain constituencies from the poll, to improve accuracy.
Also Read: Predictions, predilections, and Indian general elections For instance, the Lokniti-CSDS uses post-poll surveys with large sample sizes but echoes the need for representative samples. Their predictions have varied in accuracy, highlighting the complexities involved in electoral predictions.
Have exit polls ever got it wrong?
Historically, exit polls have had mixed accuracy. Some notable instances where exit polls diverged significantly from actual results include:
Advertisement 2004 Lok Sabha Elections: Exit polls predicted a majority for the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA government. However, the actual results saw the NDA falling short of expectations.
Delhi Assembly Elections 2015: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) secured a sweeping victory with 67 out of 70 seats, which was underestimated by exit polls.
Bihar Assembly Elections 2015: Exit polls predicted a close race, but the RJD-JDU-Congress coalition won decisively.
UP Assembly Elections 2017: Despite exit polls predicting a hung assembly, the BJP won over 300 seats.
2014 Lok Sabha Elections: Exit polls did not foresee the BJP achieving an outright majority, which it did by crossing the 272-mark on its own.
In India, exit polls are regulated under Section 126A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. This section prohibits the conduct and publication of exit polls during the polling period to avoid influencing voters.

The seventh and final phase of the Lok Sabha polls is underway with 57 parliamentary constituencies set to cast their vote across eight states and union territories.
The counting for the Lok Sabha Elections 2024 will take place on 4 June.
But what do we know about exit polls? What is their history? Why are they relevant? And what about their rules?

What are they?
Exit polls are essentially quick interviews with voters.
They are usually conducted right after voters exit the polls on voting day – as opposed to opinion polls which are conducted beforehand.
The idea behind them is to offer a snapshot of the voters’ concerns. They are aimed at predicting which party is likely to come to power.
Several news channels and agencies in India conduct exit polls – with varying degrees of success.
As per Business Standard, their accuracy depends on a slew of factors including structured questionnaires, in-person or telephonic interviews of random people for fairness, sample size, demographic representation, data compilation, and count method.
The first exit poll was conducted in 1957 by the Indian Institute of Public Opinion.
The group conducted an exit poll during the second Lok Sabha elections.
As per Hindustan Times, it was the Delhi-based Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) that pioneered in the 1960s.
But it was another two decades before exit polls began being taken seriously in the media.
This is when psephologist Prannoy Roy teamed up with David Butler.
Advertisement Roy, Butler and Ashok Lahiri would go on to publish a landmark book The Compendium of Indian Elections.
State-run Doordarshan asking the CSDS to conduct a countrywide exit poll in 1996 also brought exit polls further into the mainstream.
“Without a structured questionnaire, the data can neither be collected coherently nor be analysed systematically to arrive at vote share estimates,” Indian Express quoted Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) director Sanjay Kumar as saying.
What are the rules for exit polls?
Exit polls are governed by The Representation of People Act, 1951.
Section 126 A of the act restricts publication and dissemination of exit polls results.
Advertisement Exit polls are usually conducted right after voters exit the polls on voting day – as opposed to opinion polls which are conducted beforehand. PTI It states, “No person shall conduct any exit poll and publish or publicise by means of the print or electronic media or disseminate in any other manner, whatsoever, the result of any exit poll during such period, as may be notified by the Election Commission in this regard.”
It adds that in case of a general election, the period may commence from the beginning of the hours fixed for the poll on the first day and continue till half an hour after the closing of the poll in all the States and Union territories.
According to Business Standard, this is done so that exit polls don’t influence voters or voting patterns.
Advertisement Those who violate this provision can be sentenced to a prison term of up to two years, a fine or both.
The Election Commission first issued guidelines on exit polls in 1998. The EC under Article 324 of the Constitution barred newspapers and television news channels from publishing or broadcasting results of opinion and exit polls between 5 pm on 14 February 1998 and 5 pm on 7 March 1998. The first phase in that year’s general elections began on 16 February 1998, and the final phase began on 7 March.
As per Economic Times, the EC in 2022 said news broadcasters must not air any final, formal and definite results &ldquo;until such results are formally announced by the Election Commission of India, unless such results are carried with clear disclaimer that they are unofficial or incomplete or partial results or projections which should not be taken as final results.&rdquo;
Advertisement Why are exit polls relevant?
Because people want to know which party and candidates are likely to win &ndash; and quickly.
However, critics say that they are often left wanting when it comes to accuracy.
According to Business Standard, exit polls are also often condemned for being biased, relying on skewed data or improper sample size, and being sponsored or politically motivated. The Economic Times quoted TK Arun as saying, &ldquo;Exit polls are tricky in India. Indians are prudent people. Why would they tell a pollster anything other than what they figure out the pollster wants to hear? Suppose he voted Congress, and says so to the pollster, the BJP wins the election and extracts from pollsters details of all those who said they voted Congress, what mayhem might not follow? Why take the risk? Indians can be rational when the issue at stake is lack of faith as well.&rdquo;
In the past, exit polls have had both hits and misses galore.
According to Hindustan Times, except for the 1998 and 2014 polls, at least four Lok Sabha polls have gotten it badly wrong.
This includes two back-to-back predictions in 2004 and 2009.
The 2004 exit polls in particular were a massive failure with the pollsters completely missing the Congress coming back to power as the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA with its ‘India Shining’ slogan lost its majority.
All exit polls predicted a win for the BJP.
Again in 2009, while most pollsters gave the edge to the UPA, they completely missed a huge swing in its favour.
The UPA added 40 more seats to its tally.
A man looks at a television screen showing exit poll results after the last phase of the general election in Ahmedabad on 19 May 2019. File photo/Reuters In 2014, the BJP won over 330 seats.
While most pollsters said then prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi and the BJP-led NDA would cross the 272 mark, almost none of them forecast the decisive performance.
It was only pollster Chanakya, who predicted 340 seats for the NDA, that came close to getting it spot on.
In 2019, most pollsters predicted that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA government would return &ndash; albeit with a reduced margin compared to the previous election. Of course, we know that the pollsters yet again underestimated the strength of the BJP-led NDA, which would nab 353 seats.

"Predictions, predilections, and Indian general elections",https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/predictions-predilections-and-indian-general-elections-13775669.html,Election predictions are notoriously hard due to the changing nature of the parameters,"Predictions are awfully difficult, even with the reassuring crunch of numbers! And yet, they are our fatal predilection, whether the challenge is for our pleasure or for that of others. Be it the stock market, astrology, or gambling, our insatiable curiosity for the mysterious and unknown is probably what propels such abandonment.
Take the ongoing Lok Sabha polls, going on for perhaps too long now, and the concomitant barrage of prophecies from TV channels, from YouTube “influenczars” and from downright bored individuals, all of whom shoot off their incendiary numbers into the tinder of social media. These soothsayers speak from relative ignorance and mostly from a fascination for a particular party, be they pidis or bhakts.They speak with the confidence that they can actually fool all the people all the time, with Abraham Lincoln being the ultimate fool, poor man. What is most horrendous is that all of them have declared random numbers like 180, 200, 250, 272, 303, 320, 362, 370, and the ace of spades, 400, long before all the votes have come in. This is why I liken election predictions in India to gambling. It is matka guessing in a satta bazar. Parrot talk, or tarot talk, it leads to no concrete outcome. It does not affect the choices made by the voters, choices one suspects were cast in stone, long before the elections were even announced. And yet, these delirious djinns persist, as their minds are made up too. The happy side to this sad fantasy is that it is time-bound, and we can all reclaim our normal lives on June 4.
Advertisement Lighter comments aside, there is a more serious side to prediction, based on the assumption that future events are influenced to some or a greater extent by what has happened before. History is our greatest teacher. The art and science of good prediction lie in identifying which past (or present) event will likely influence an event to come. Let us take the Indian monsoon, an annual event of major economic importance to our nation, and one that has just begun this year. It would help the government enormously if it knew a few months in advance if the monsoon were to be normal, below average, or will punch above its weight.
At present, the Indian monsoon is predicted using a combination of atmospheric models, sea surface temperature analysis, historical data, and satellite observations. Key factors include the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, the Indian Ocean Dipole, and wind patterns. Advanced computational models simulate these variables to forecast rainfall and monsoon onset accurately. However, there are totally different methods of monsoon prediction that would not be considered ‘scientific’ by western definition, but are yet chillingly accurate. Traditionally, some Indian communities predict the monsoon by observing the nesting behaviour of certain birds, like the Indian weaver bird (Baya Weaver). It is believed that if these birds build their nests on higher branches, a heavier monsoon will ensue. Conversely, lower nests indicate lighter rainfall. This method relies on the birds&rsquo; instinctive response to environmental cues, and seems to be largely reliable. Nature lovers might like to correlate this occurrence with the Japanese kō or 72 micro-seasons, for further poetic justification.
Advertisement Prediction is a key aspect of science, and the smaller the number of known events, phenomena, and parameters used to predict a large number of future events accurately, the better the value of the prediction. At the risk of introducing an equation in this column, one can say the value of a prediction, V = (N/n) – 1, where one is able to correctly predict N outcomes with n parameters. According to this equation, the value of a prediction is zero if one needs n parameters to predict N outcomes.
Let’s apply this equation to the present Lok Sabha election. We could say that N = 543, in other words, we want to correctly predict the results from 543 constituencies. How many parameters would we need, or what is the value of n, for a good prediction? What our present-day pollsters are doing, in trying to improve the accuracy of their guesses, is to increase the number of parameters to absurd levels. They ask whether all the Muslim women in Kishanganj will vote like their menfolk, whether the hot summer days in Ramagundam will harm voting, or whether all the Gounders in Kovai will stay loyal to the AIADMK. The problem with such micro-parameters is that they cannot be quantified properly. Informal surveys on the ground may not be the answer because all respondents may not answer truthfully. We see ludicrous statements from politicians—some say that low turnouts hurt the BJP, while others say that low turnouts hurt the Congress. Others say that a low or high turnout may help or hurt a party, depending on the state. Still others say that whatever happens, Congress is winning. The problem with any or all of this is that none of it can be either proven or disproven—this makes it non-scientific. The reader will appreciate that as n increases with all these unprovable parameters, the value of the prediction quickly goes to zero. It is easier to say that there is only one parameter in this election, and that is the prime minister himself. Applying the equation, the value of my prediction is (543/1) – 1 = 542, which in practical terms means a sizable majority for the BJP. I think I’m doing pretty well for myself with this prediction. June 4 will tell.
Advertisement What I would have liked to see, and what seems missing, is a more accurate assessment of ‘swing’ constituencies in bellwether states. No expert needs to predict that the BJP will win in Gandhinagar or that it will lose in South Kolkata. On the other hand, if the BJP were to win in Thiruvananthapuram, Bengaluru Rural, Hyderabad, or Central Chennai, this would signify that winds of change are blowing across the country. The very high voter turnout in Baramulla is another pointer. An ability to extrapolate from this to an accurate prediction about the Kashmir Valley in particular and the country in general, is what is missing. Once again, what I would like to see on June 4 is how soon any particular TV channel is able to call the election, say by 9, 10, or 11 am? The sooner it is able to do this, the better its reports will be and the less fluff and bluff.
Advertisement Election predictions are notoriously hard due to the changing nature of the parameters, something we do not usually see in science. The Truman-Dewey US presidential election of 1945, was made memorable by the photograph of the victor, Harry Truman, brandishing a copy of the Chicago Tribune that screamed the wrong headline, “Dewey defeats Truman”. So close was the vote. At the end of World War II, the UK voted against Winston Churchill, their doughty PM, who had saved them from Nazi tyranny. He was hustled out of office when the Labour Party won by a substantial majority. Can we ever imagine a similar situation in India? And yet, some of our own elections have indeed yielded surprising results, and one recollects 1971, 1977, and 2019, when the decisiveness of the mandate was quite something else.

Lok Sabha elections 2024: How many candidates have criminal cases against them?,https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/lok-sabha-elections-2024-how-many-candidates-have-criminal-cases-against-them-13774183.html,"A comprehensive analysis of the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) shows that 1,644 of the 8,337 candidates contesting in the ongoing Lok Sabha elections have criminal cases registered against them, including allegations of murder, attempted murder, crimes against women, and hate speech","The Lok Sabha election in India is nearing its conclusion. Before the sixth and seventh phases on 25 May and 1 June, the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) has carried out an analysis, which shows that 1,644 of the 8,337 candidates contesting in the ongoing Lok Sabha elections have criminal cases registered against them.
Of these candidates, 1,188 face serious criminal charges, including allegations of murder, attempted murder, crimes against women, and hate speech.
Advertisement Here is a phase-by-phase analysis.
Phase 1: 19 April
In phase 1, out of 1,618 candidates analysed, 252 have criminal cases and 161 serious criminal cases.
According to the ADR, seven candidates face murder charges, while 19 are involved in attempted murder cases. Eighteen candidates have declared cases of crimes against women in their affidavits, with one facing a rape charge under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).
Another 35 candidates are linked to cases of hate speech.
Phase 2: 26 April
In the second phase, 1,192 candidates were analysed with 250 of them facing criminal charges and 167 serious criminal cases. Three candidates face murder charges, while 24 are involved in attempted murder cases, the report revealed.
Twenty-five candidates have declared cases related to crimes against women, with one facing rape charges under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The analysis revealed that twenty-one candidates have been linked to cases of hate speech.
It also revealed that 52 per cent of the 87 seats in the second phase of seven-phase elections are &lsquo;red alert&rsquo; constituencies. ‘Red alert’ constituencies are those where three or more candidates have declared criminal cases in their affidavits.
Phase 3: 7 May
In phase 3, out of 1,352 candidates, 244 have criminal cases and 172 serious criminal cases, 18 per cent of the total candidates in the fray.
Advertisement Among the 244 candidates with criminal records, five face murder charges, while 24 have been booked for attempted murder.
In addition, 38 candidates have been linked to crimes against women, with 17 declared cases of hate speech.
Seven candidates have also declared prior convictions.
Phase 4: 13 May
Phase 4 had the highest number — of the 1,710 candidates analysed, 360 have criminal charges against them and 274 serious criminal charges.
According to the data, 17 of the 360 candidates (21 per cent) with criminal cases were convicted, 11 declared cases of murder, 30 face attempted murder charges, and 50 have criminal cases related to crimes against women, with 5 facing rape charges.
Advertisement Phase 5: 20 May
Phase 5 included 695 candidates, of which 159 have criminal cases and 122 serious criminal cases. Around 18 per cent were facing serious criminal charges, including those related to murder, attempted murder, and crimes against women.
Twenty-eight of these candidates are charged with attempted murder (IPC Section 307), while four are charged with murder (IPC Section 302).
In addition, one of the 29 candidates accused of crimes against women faces rape charges (IPC Section 376). The analysis also identifies ten candidates who have given inflammatory speeches, which can incite violence and cause communal discord.
Phase 6: 25 May
In phase 6, out of 866 candidates analysed, 180 have criminal cases and 141 have serious criminal cases. Out of the total, 141 (16 per cent) candidates have declared serious criminal cases against them.

This was also going to be the biggest election in the world’s biggest democracy. With over 900 million broadband subscribers, the Indian voter is more plugged into the commentary of the voting analysis, trends and outcomes.
The cacophony of election analysis is hardwired into the heads of Indian citizens through their phones and devices, their choices dictated by opinions and beliefs, which in turn has been an outcome of results seen in the last five years. Yet, when I went to cast my vote this Monday, the booth-level machinery was so well-oiled and efficient that beyond the cacophony of election sloganeering and digital pyrotechnics, the unassuming power of silent citizens dutifully stepping up to vote on their appointed day, sans drama or hyperbole, held up a useful guide for the rest of the world to emulate.
Advertisement India, the world’s most populous democracy, is currently holding its general election over a seven-phase period that continues for seven weeks. Indians can vote between 19 April and 1 June, with the results set to be declared on 4 June.
The World Decides in 2024
Over fifty elections take place in 2024, including some of the most impacting ones such as the US, Russia, India, Taiwan. Fifty-one per cent of the world will either have a new dispensation or continue with the existing one. As elections take place across the world, the festival of democracy in India is expected to be among the keenly contested, fair and well organised ones in the world.
These elections have also proved that India sets consistent standards in choosing their leaders, disproving a biased opinion about democracy and elections that certain western thinking has held towards India. Using a template of a fairness score to evaluate the independence of elections in countries, as a well-known western publication recently did, reduces the process of choices in elections to a rating number which can both end up being biased and patronising, and is dictated by a long-held expectation that Indian polls are simultaneously cantankerous and exotic — a work in progress democracy that promises to be civilised but is never one. It also served to quietly aid a narrative that the democratic processes in the west are superior.
Advertisement Why India’s Free Elections Trumps West’s Bias
Take for instance, the freedom and fairness score accorded to India’s elections, which is 0.53 and compare it to the other nations in their leadup to the elections. Mexico is a country heading for elections this year. In this election cycle, 30 candidates have already been assassinated, according to data from the research firm Laboratorio Electoral. In 2021, 30 candidates were killed while in 2018, the elections saw 24 killings. These elections are expected to be among the most violent. According to western pundits, Mexico has a freedom and fairness score of 0.75 in the conduct of elections, which indicates the elections are more ‘just and fair’ than in India. Parts of western media has been unduly harsh on India, rating its fairness score of elections at 0.53.
Advertisement In Indonesia, the electoral process is still dominated by corrupt or influential leaders who grew powerful during the authoritarian rule of Suharto. Democracy is new, and power oscillated between influential stakeholders, till Joko Widodo, an outsider, broke the stranglehold. Thereafter, a general took over as President — one the west has accused of human rights abuses. Interestingly, Indonesia’s freedom and fairness score stands at 0.68, higher than India. Which means that the credibility of Indian elections is just about better than the banana republics — an assumption that betrays the negative bias of such studies.
The US, rated high in freedom and fairness index by the publication, struggled under serious allegations of tampering and influence by Russia and the subsequent response of Trump supporters laying siege in Washington DC after losing the elections indicated a democracy that was functional but not civilised. On the other hand, far from the history of some of the nations, who have either embraced dysfunctional democracy along the way or seem to be falling by the wayside in terms of their law and order situation in the lead up to the elections, India has maintained an enviable record of holding free and fair elections over seven decades.
Advertisement The Decisive Indian Vote
From the general election held in 1951-52 in which 17.5 crore Indians, voted in the elections to the 18th Lok Sabha that are under way, the process has evolved and matured along with Indian democracy over the decades. So have the voters graduated, from being largely illiterate to being well informed and technically savvy while making choices.
The CEC explained why the voluntary nature of casting votes means that the ECI operates ‘in an entirely persuasive space, inviting the citizens to volunteer to become part of the electoral roll and, thereafter, through systematic voter awareness programmes, motivates them to exercise their franchise.’ There is a high elector to population ratio which underpins the discipline, patience and belief that Indian voters have demonstrated in executing the process. The power of Indian elections demonstrates a growing, emerging India that is willing and ready to show how democracy is a proven political system in this world. Take for instance the example of Jammu and Kashmir.
Advertisement Since 1989, all earlier elections in the region had been plagued by violence and a tendence towards anarchy, influenced by separatist parties. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Anantnag, Srinagar and Baramulla — the Lok Sabha seats — recorded dismal attendance.
Baramulla recorded 46 per cent voting in 1996. Thereafter it has struggled to have voters on election days. Twenty-eight years later, 59 per cent of Baramulla showed up to vote on polling day, breaking the previous record.
This time, local political leaders have addressed large crowds who are keen to be a part of the time-tested process of democracy and express their opinions at the poll booths, unlike earlier times when boycotts dominated Kashmiri elections and the turnout, cowed down by the gun, often struggled to crawl out of single digit percentage attendance.
The resolve to bring Kashmir out of a rut of decades-old militancy by taking the gun out of the equation has helped locals trust the power of the ballot in making lives better instead of being ruled by fear of militancy. There is a growing curiosity about the choices available in a democracy through the power of the ballot, which many people in the state now see value in, unlike across the border where democracy is in shambles and offers no choices.
Younger India: 18 Million First-Time Voters
One of the key aspects in these elections is the addition of over 2-crore young first time voters. These voters, in each successive edition, are going to boost a voting population that consumes digital information and has a strong sense of independent opinion. A keen interest among young voters has led to parties canvassing through digital platforms. An increasingly politically conscious, intelligent but less patient voter base has meant that parties have had to address more matured issues – which also tells us how India has travelled a fair distance from the days when Garibi Hatao was a dominating slogan.
The voter turnout, lower in the early stages, yet reflects an involved participation of its citizens across the country. In a country where different belief systems have held sway, the one common space where India comes together as a country is its general election. Which is why, an election season resembles a festival of choices rather than a mere mechanical process of choosing.
India Votes for the World to Emulate
In the previous national edition in 2019, the Election Commission confirmed a 67 per cent turnout. The Americans were marginally higher in the same period while voting in their elections. The Indian elections have also been among the most expensive elections, in which political parties spent more than 7 billion in 2019, higher than the spends in the US elections in that period. Not only are the Indian general elections the largest poll show on earth — they are also the most intensely contested and certainly, sets the bar for America to follow this November.
While wars and conflicts singe the world in most parts and certain nations have gone berserk losing their way while making choices, India proves yet again that this election festival of citizens is not only the biggest but also the most civilised and sane process on earth.

"Busy dousing fire on Swati Maliwal 'assault' row, AAP loses a week of Kejriwal's freedom and fought against itself than rivals",https://www.firstpost.com/india/busy-dousing-fire-on-swati-maliwal-assault-row-aap-loses-a-week-of-kejriwals-freedom-and-fought-against-itself-than-rivals-13772369.html,"Amid the escalating blame game, the focus abruptly moved from Arvind Kejriwal to Swati Maliwal and the internal feud between Maliwal and other AAP members overshadowed Kejriwal&rsquo;s continuous attacks on the prime minister and the BJP","When the Supreme Court granted interim bail to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on 10 May until 2 June, the AAP leader had a clear agenda ahead. Arrested on 21 March by the Enforcement Directorate in the liquor policy case, Kejriwal now had 21 days to capitalise on his temporary release. His primary focus would have been to generate publicity for himself and the AAP by intensifying his criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP.
Advertisement The Maliwal incident: A shift in focus
This situation progressed smoothly until the Swati Maliwal incident on 13 May. On that day, AAP Rajya Sabha MP Swati Maliwal accused Bibhav Kumar, a member of Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal&rsquo;s personal staff of misconduct. Following her allegations, the Delhi Police arrested Kejriwal&rsquo;s private assistant Bibhav Kumar, igniting a dual conflict: AAP versus BJP and Swati Maliwal versus the rest of AAP.
Amid the escalating blame game, two significant shifts occurred. First, the focus abruptly moved from Arvind Kejriwal to Swati Maliwal. Second, the internal feud between Maliwal and other AAP members overshadowed Kejriwal&rsquo;s continuous attacks on the prime minister and the BJP.
Significantly, this incident consumed a crucial portion of Kejriwal&rsquo;s 21 days of freedom with an entire week diverted to the Maliwal controversy.
Strategic reorientation
Regardless of whether AAP inadvertently fell into a trap or recognised the situation belatedly, Kejriwal understood the pressing need to redirect attention back to himself. He needed to refocus the battle onto BJP territory and distance the party from the Maliwal incident. Whether it was genuine support for his long-time aide Kumar or a strategy to revitalise AAP, the Delhi chief minister knew that a significant move was necessary to reclaim the spotlight.
What better way to do it than challenge Prime Minister Modi to arrest all AAP leaders as he announced on Saturday that he would march to BJP headquarters in Delhi on Sunday at noon accompanied by all the prominent leaders of his party. More the chaos better the publicity.
Advertisement Kejriwal alleged that the BJP was trying to completely destroy AAP through Operation Jhadu. He shared that people who were familiar with both the BJP and him had informed him that Prime Minister Modi acknowledged AAP&rsquo;s growing influence and the global discussion around their work. Kejriwal said that the BJP saw AAP as a potential tough challenger in several states and wanted to eliminate them. He made these statements while addressing the press at the party office on Sunday.
Importance of Delhi for AAP
Voting for all seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi is scheduled for 25 May as part of Phase 6 of the polling.
Advertisement Delhi is of paramount importance to the AAP for several reasons. It is the party&rsquo;s primary base and stronghold where it was founded and first achieved significant political success by winning the Delhi Legislative Assembly elections in 2013. Maintaining control over Delhi is essential for AAP&rsquo;s political legitimacy and influence. Furthermore, Delhi serves as a showcase for AAP&rsquo;s governance model and policies.
AAP finds itself grappling with the challenge of maintaining a focussed engagement with its diverse electorate in Delhi, which encompasses various socioeconomic groups. Amid its efforts to highlight flagship programmes such as mohalla clinics, subsidised electricity and its work in government schools, the controversy surrounding Maliwal has diverted public attention from these areas which AAP would have wanted to bring in front of the voters.
Advertisement Whether the Maliwal incident is indeed a premeditated attack on AAP as the party alleges or simply a coincidence only time will reveal. However, there is no doubt that it has placed AAP in a defensive position precisely when it was gearing up for a strong offensive. Whether it&rsquo;s a calculated move by a political mastermind or just an unfortunate stroke of fate remains uncertain for now.

How Swati Maliwal row is disrupting Arvind Kejriwal’s campaign for Lok Sabha polls,https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/swati-maliwal-row-arvind-kejriwal-13772041.html,"While Arvind Kejriwal&rsquo;s release from jail to campaign for the Lok Sabha polls came as a big relief to the AAP and the Opposition, the Swati Maliwal controversy has cast a pall over proceedings. While the Delhi chief minister has remained mum over the matter, the party has claimed that there is a &lsquo;BJP conspiracy&rsquo; to frame him","Arvind Kejriwal must have felt great relief when he was granted bail by the Supreme Court.
The apex court granted the Delhi chief minister bail in the alleged money laundering case in order to campaign for the Lok Sabha polls.
But the controversy over Swati Maliwal has dogged Kejriwal at every step.
Maliwal, the AAP&rsquo;s Rajya Sabha MP, filed an FIR on Thursday accusing the Delhi chief minister&rsquo;s aide Bibhav Kumar of assaulting her. Advertisement The AAP has alleged a conspiracy is being hatched against Kejriwal, while the BJP has demanded stringent action against the accused.
Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at how the row has disrupted his campaign:
Kejriwal&rsquo;s release from jail was a big boost to the party and the Opposition.
The Times of India quoted Sandeep Pathak, a close aide of Kejriwal who is overseeing the AAP Lok Sabha campaign, as saying the development breathed fresh life into the party.
&ldquo;With him, the cadre feels happier, much more positive, much more charged. That’s one aspect of it. The other is that the BJP thought that they would get Kejriwal arrested and then start breaking up the AAP in Delhi and Punjab. But they miserably failed,&rdquo; the AAP Rajya Sabha MP said.
But Maliwal&rsquo;s accusations have now cast a pall over proceedings.
&ldquo;While the whole truth is not out yet, all is certainly not well inside the AAP. There have been reports of differences between Kejriwal and Maliwal for some time. There are claims that Kejriwal was not happy with Maliwal&rsquo;s absence from Delhi before and after his arrest as well as her relative silence on his arrest. Maliwal, however, was reportedly visiting her sister in the US,&rdquo; the piece stated.
It noted that if Kejriwal is sent to jail again for a long time, the party is likely to fracture. But if he is granted regular bail, he will likely be able to keep his team together.
&ldquo;What was supposed to be a few weeks of respite for Kejriwal are proving to be a testing period. His attention will now be divided between the election campaign and the party affairs,&rdquo; the piece noted.
Advertisement On Wednesday some people also raised slogans during Kejriwal&rsquo;s road show in Chandni Chowk against Kumar, as per The Times of India.
&lsquo;Slapped, hit in stomach&rsquo;
Maliwal in her FIR filed Thursday claimed she was &ldquo;slapped, hit in the stomach and kicked&rdquo; by Kumar.
The FIR was registered after Maliwal&rsquo;s statement was recorded by a two-member team led by Additional Commissioner of Police P.S. Kushwaha.
The team was at Maliwal&rsquo;s residence in central Delhi for nearly four and a half hours.
AAP Rajya Sabha MP Swati Maliwal has accused Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal&rsquo;s aide of assault. PTI File Photo Maliwal claimed she ran out of the CM&rsquo;s residence and called the police immediately after the incident.
Kejriwal was present at his residence when the incident took place, she added.
Advertisement Maliwal broke down several times while giving the statement and sought strict action against Kumar.
The AAP MP on Thursday underwent medical check-up at All India Institute of Medical Sciences.
Kejriwal evades question, BJP attacks
Adding fuel to the fire, Kejriwal on Wednesday did not address Maliwal&rsquo;s allegations during a press conference.
Kejriwal, flanked by Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav and AAP Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh, evaded a question on the subject.
Singh, however, said his party has already made its stand clear on the issue.
#WATCH | Lucknow, UP: On AAP Rajya Sabha MP Swati Maliwal&#39;s assault case, AAP MP Sanjay Singh says &quot;The entire country was in pain after seeing what happened in Manipur but PM Modi was silent on the issue. Prajwal Revanna raped thousands of women but PM Modi was asking for votes… pic.twitter.com/nQu73jcqNQ
&mdash; ANI (@ANI) May 16, 2024 Advertisement Singh, who had met Maliwal at her residence on Wednesday, said, &ldquo;The AAP is our family. Party has made its view clear.&rdquo;
He also targeted the BJP government at the Centre by raising the issue of a Manipuri woman being paraded naked, the Prajwal Revanna sex scandal and Maliwal being &ldquo;beaten up&rdquo; by police during protests by wrestlers when she was the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) chief.
Advertisement &ldquo;I want that BJP and PM should also answer on the issues I have kept before you. He (PM) should answer on the issue of Swati Maliwal, who was dragged and beaten when she went to seek justice for the female wrestlers. I just want to say don&rsquo;t play political games on the issues,&rdquo; he said.
Yadav then took the microphone and said &ldquo;there are more important things than that&rdquo;.
Then, unfolding a piece of paper, he added, &ldquo;BJP people are not with anyone, it is a &lsquo;gang&rsquo; that lodges false cases&rdquo;.
Singh at a press conference on Tuesday had accepted that Kumar had &ldquo;misbehaved&rdquo; with Maliwal.
He also labelled the incident &lsquo;highly condemnable&rsquo;, as per The Times of India.
BJP national spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia claimed that Kejriwal is the main &ldquo;criminal&rdquo; in the complaint that his aide Kumar had physically attacked Maliwal at the chief minister&rsquo;s residence, as he cited the telephone call she had made to the Delhi Police to report the matter.
&ldquo;His (Kejriwal) silence speaks a lot. Out of jail, he is more a &lsquo;goonda&rsquo; than a chief minister,&rdquo; he told reporters, noting that Kumar was seen with the chief minister in Lucknow.
Stringent action should be taken against the accused in the case, he said.
Kumar, he noted, was photographed with Kejriwal during his visit to Lucknow.
On Friday, the Delhi BJP Mahila Morcha members staged a protest near Kejriwal&rsquo;s residence.
Led by Mahila Morcha president Richa Pandey Mishra, the protesters, who were carrying bangles, demanded Kejriwal&rsquo;s resignation.
Mishra said the Mahila Morcha wanted to hand over the bangles to Kejriwal for keeping mum over the incident with Maliwal that occurred at his official residence.
“Arvind Kejriwal should be ashamed. He should resign from his post and apologise to the country. Swati Maliwal should get justice,&quot; a Mahila Morcha member told PTI.
The Mahila Morcha of the Delhi BJP also extended support to Maliwal, writing a letter to her saying the incident was a matter of honour of women in the country.
A team of the Delhi Police also turned up at Kejriwal&rsquo;s residence on Friday, as per India Today.
&lsquo;BJP conspiracy to frame Kejirwal&rsquo;
Meanwhile, the AAP has claimed the case is a &lsquo;BJP conspiracy to frame Kejriwal.&rsquo;
Senior AAP leader Atishi at a press conference said, &ldquo;Today a video has surfaced that has exposed the lie of Maliwal. In her FIR, she has said she was brutally assaulted and she was in pain, and buttons of her shirt were torn. A video that has surfaced shows an entirely different reality.&rdquo;
Atishi said the video shows Maliwal &ldquo;comfortably sitting in the drawing room&rdquo; and &ldquo;threatening the security staff&rdquo;, and that &ldquo;her clothes were not torn&rdquo;.
&ldquo;The video shows her threatening Kumar. The charges levelled by Maliwal are baseless. Maliwal insisted on meeting Kejriwal. She is Rajya Sabha MP and she should know that the CM has a busy schedule. Kumar told her that the chief minister is busy and unable to meet her. She shouted at him, pushed him and tried to enter the residential portion of the CM House,&rdquo; she claimed.
&ldquo;The whole incident proves that it was a BJP conspiracy and Swati Maliwal was made its face to frame Kejriwal,&rdquo; she alleged.
Asked about Singh accepting misbehaviour with Maliwal, Atishi said, &ldquo;AAP MP Sanjay Singh met Maliwal and he had only her version. But now this video has brought out the truth.&rdquo;

Here&rsquo;s what the News18 exit poll has predicted for the NDA and the INDI Alliance in some of the big states,"The voting for the Lok Sabha elections has come to an end and it’s been a lengthy process — seven long phases spread over six weeks. Now, it’s time to shift attention to the results. Before the results are announced on 4 June, here’s what the exit polls reveal.
Most exit polls are predicting a return of the Narendra Modi-led NDA government, winning over 350 seats, with the Opposition’s INDI Alliance managing somewhere between 125 and 150. News18 conducted its own mega exit poll, according to which NDA has bagged 355-370 seats, while the INDI Alliance has won 125-140 seats.
Advertisement But how has the NDA fared against the INDI Alliance in each state? We break through the clutter and present the results of the News18 mega exit poll in quick, easy graphics.
NORTH
The NDA, as per News18&rsquo;s exit poll, will continue its dominance in the north. In Uttar Pradesh, the NDA is poised to win 68-71 of the 80 seats, while the INDI Alliance is predicted to win nine-12 seats.
In Bihar, the NDA, of which Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s JDU is a part, will be bagging 31-34 seats, while INDI Alliance is believed to get six-nine seats. Delhi and Haryana is all about the NDA once again.
SOUTH
In the South, it seems a Narendra Modi-led push has helped the BJP. Exit polls predict an improved performance of the BJP in the five southern states. It seems in Andhra Pradesh, the alliance with Chandrababu Naidu-led Telugu Desam Party has paid big dividends for the BJP, with the NDA emerging on top. In Telangana, the News18 exit poll gives BJP a big reason to smile, predicting the party to win seven-10 seats, compared to Congress’ five-eight.
Karnataka is also expected to vote overwhelmingly for the BJP, despite its preference for the Congress at the state level. In Tamil Nadu, the party is even expected to make a debut, securing between one-three seats, exit polls predict.
Advertisement The Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) is set to sweep Kerala once, while the BJP-led NDA will open its account in the southern state.
EAST
The News18 exit poll predicts that the BJP-led NDA will build on its 2019 performance in the east. In West Bengal, the BJP seems to be the biggest winner, with the Mamata Banerjee led TMC trailing behind. And in Assam, it&rsquo;s NDA all the way, predicted to win 10-13 seats.
Another big surprise is from the state of Odisha. The exit poll has predicted a clean sweep for the BJP. The poll predicts the BJP will win 13-15 seats, with the BJD to come in second with six-eight seats.
Advertisement WEST
In the West, the BJP-led NDA is predicted to be the big winner as per the exit poll. Gujarat is the big news here with the NDA set to be sweeping all 26 seats. Meanwhile, in Maharashtra, the NDA is predicted to win 32-35 seats, with the INDI Alliance winning 15-18 seats.
In Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, it&rsquo;s all about the NDA once again. The News18 exit poll predicts 26-29 seats for the NDA out of the 29 seats. In Rajasthan, the NDA is predicted to win 18-25 seats.

But how did they fare in 2014 and 2019? Which pollster got it right and which missed the mark?","Voting for the seventh and final phase of the Lok Sabha polls concluded today.
Now, with the counting of votes scheduled for 4 June, all eyes are on the exit polls. The exit polls have been released at 6.30 pm.
This is in line with the Section 126A of the Representation of the People’s Act, 1951, which states that exit polls can only be aired half an hour after the completion of the final phase of voting.
Advertisement But what did they predict in 2014 and 2019? And how accurate are exit polls really?
Let’s take a closer look:
2014
Going into 2014, pollsters were under some pressure.
After all, the exit polls had failed to get it right in back-to-back Lok Sabha elections.
In 2004, the polls predicated that the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA, which was relying on the ‘India shining’ campaign, would win big.
However, the Congress made a huge comeback in 2004.
In 2009, the exit polls predicted the UPA would get the most seats, but that the result would be a hung Parliament.
The Congress-led coalition defied the odds yet again with the Grand Old Party itself getting 200 seats.
In 2014, all the exit polls favoured the BJP-led NDA under Narendra Modi.
For NDA
The News24-Chanakya poll predicted that the NDA would nab 340 seats, while the India Today-Cicero poll gave the coalition 272 seats. The CNN-IBN-CSDS said the alliance would win 280 seats, while the Times Now poll gave the NDA.
The ABP News-Nielsen predicted 274 seats for the NDA, while the NDTV-Hansa Research estimated 279 seats for the NDA.
For UPA
For the UPA, the India Today-Cicero pollster predicted 115 seats, while News 24-Chanakya estimated 101 seats. The CNN-IBN-CSDS gave the alliance 97 seats, while Times Now projected 148 seats.
Advertisement The ABP News-Nielsen said the UPA would win 97 seats, while NDTV-Hansa Research said the alliance would net 103 seats.
Pollsters seemed to underestimate the hunger for change in the public mind as well as the sheer scale of the NDA’s victory and the UPA’s defeat.
Of all the pollsters, the News24-Chanakya was most on the money.
Advertisement The NDA would go on to win a massive 336 seats with the BJP itself crossing the half-way mark in Parliament and netting 282 seats.
The UPA, on the other hand, would be reduced to just 60 seats with the Congress winning 44 seats by its lonesome.
2019 polls
In 2019, most pollsters predicted that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA government would return – albeit with a reduced margin.
For NDA
The India Today-Axis pollster predicted that the NDA would win between 339 and 365 seats, while the News 24-Today’s Chanakya gave the alliance 350 seats.
The News18-IPSOS poll said the NDA would net 336 seats, while Times Now-VMR predicted 306 seats for the NDA.
The India TV-CNX pollster estimated 300 seats for the alliance, while the Sudarshan News poll gave the NDA 305 seats.
Advertisement For UPA
Meanwhile, for the UPA, the India Today-Axi poll predicted between 77 and 108 seats, while the News 24-Today’s Chanakya estimated 95 seats.
The News18-IPSOS poll said the UPA would win 82 seats, while the Times Now-VMR poll gave the alliance 132 seats.
The India TV-CNX predicted 120 seats for the UPA, while Sudarshan News estimated the alliance would net 124 seats.
The India Today-Axis gave the UPA between 77 and 108 seats, while News 24-Today’s Chanakya predicted 95 seats.
Most of the pollsters yet again failed to gauge the popularity of the BJP-led NDA.
Advertisement The NDA, incredibly, ended up bettering its 2014 tally in a resounding vote of confidence in Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The alliance won 352 seats with the BJP itself winning 303 seats.
Meanwhile, the Congress-led UPA expanded its tally to 91 seats with the grand old party winning 52 seats – but it was nothing to write home about.
The News 24-Today’s Chanakya was yet again the most accurate pollster.
Are exit polls accurate?
Not necessarily.
As noted above, pollsters have been off the mark with remarkable frequency in at least four recent Lok Sabha elections including 2004 and 2009.
Exit polls are also often condemned for being biased, relying on skewed data or improper sample size, and being sponsored or politically motivated, Business Standard.
The Economic Times quoted TK Arun as saying, “Exit polls are tricky in India. Indians are prudent people. Why would they tell a pollster anything other than what they figure out the pollster wants to hear? Suppose he voted Congress, and says so to the pollster, the BJP wins the election and extracts from pollsters details of all those who said they voted Congress, what mayhem might not follow? Why take the risk? Indians can be rational when the issue at stake is lack of faith as well.”
In short, exit polls can be hazardous to a political junkie’s health.

Lok Sabha Election 2024: How are exit polls conducted and are they accurate?,https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-are-exit-polls-conducted-how-accurate-are-exit-polls-lok-sabha-elections-2024-exit-polls-general-elections-13777162.html,"The largest democratic exercise in the world, India&rsquo;s 18th Lok Sabha Elections, concludes today. Following the 44-day electoral process, exit polls will commence, providing predictions on the likely victors and the extent of their triumph. What are these polls? Do they always get it right?","India&rsquo;s 18th Lok Sabha Elections, the largest democratic exercise on the planet, will conclude on 1 June, 2024 as the seventh phase comes to a close . As the lengthy 44-day electoral process ends, attention will shift to exit polls, which are expected to provide insights into the election outcomes starting from 6:30 pm on 1 June.
Exit polls are crucial for gauging the mood of the electorate and predicting the likely winners before the official results are declared. However, their accuracy and methodology are often subjects of debate and scrutiny.
Advertisement What is the methodology behind exit polls?
Exit polls are conducted by surveying voters immediately after they cast their votes. This method contrasts with opinion polls, which are conducted before the elections to gather voters&rsquo; views on various issues and candidates. Exit polls aim to provide a snapshot of voting trends, influenced by various factors such as issues, personalities, and party loyalties.
The methodology of exit polls involves interviewing voters outside polling stations using a structured questionnaire. This approach relies on the voters&rsquo; recent experiences, increasing the likelihood of obtaining accurate responses.

AP The data collected is then analysed to estimate vote shares and predict seat outcomes. These polls are typically conducted by private firms or media organisations rather than government agencies.
How has technology changed conducting exit polls?
Technological advancements have significantly influenced the conduct of exit polls. Techniques such as call-backs to respondents, images of interviews being conducted, phone calls from the field, and WhatsApp groups have enhanced data collection and analysis.
Despite these advancements, ensuring the accuracy of predictions remains challenging due to the complex and diverse nature of the Indian electorate.

AP Structured questionnaires are vital for coherent data collection and systematic analysis, reported Indian Express. The Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) emphasises the importance of representative samples in ensuring accurate predictions. A large sample size is crucial, but the representativeness of the sample is equally important.
Advertisement What challenges are faced while conducting exit polls?
Estimating vote shares and predicting seat outcomes are the primary challenges in conducting exit polls. The swing model, which relies on past election results, is influenced by various factors such as geographic location, caste, religion, and economic class.
Changes in political alliances between elections can also affect predictions. The prediction process is labour-intensive and time-consuming, as it involves making estimates for each seat.

AP The complexity of swings increases with the number of political players. For example, the BJP and JD(U) alliance in Bihar poses a challenge for the swing model. Over- or under-representation of diverse voter sections can impact the accuracy of estimates.
Advertisement How accurate are exit polls?
The accuracy of exit polls depends on various factors beyond sample size. The representativeness of the sample, the methodology used, and the ability to account for diverse voter profiles are critical. Some agencies rely on innovative methods, such as eliminating certain constituencies from the poll, to improve accuracy.
Also Read: Predictions, predilections, and Indian general elections For instance, the Lokniti-CSDS uses post-poll surveys with large sample sizes but echoes the need for representative samples. Their predictions have varied in accuracy, highlighting the complexities involved in electoral predictions.
Have exit polls ever got it wrong?
Historically, exit polls have had mixed accuracy. Some notable instances where exit polls diverged significantly from actual results include:
Advertisement 2004 Lok Sabha Elections: Exit polls predicted a majority for the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA government. However, the actual results saw the NDA falling short of expectations.
Delhi Assembly Elections 2015: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) secured a sweeping victory with 67 out of 70 seats, which was underestimated by exit polls.
Bihar Assembly Elections 2015: Exit polls predicted a close race, but the RJD-JDU-Congress coalition won decisively.
UP Assembly Elections 2017: Despite exit polls predicting a hung assembly, the BJP won over 300 seats.
2014 Lok Sabha Elections: Exit polls did not foresee the BJP achieving an outright majority, which it did by crossing the 272-mark on its own.
In India, exit polls are regulated under Section 126A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. This section prohibits the conduct and publication of exit polls during the polling period to avoid influencing voters.

What are they?
Exit polls are essentially quick interviews with voters.
They are usually conducted right after voters exit the polls on voting day – as opposed to opinion polls which are conducted beforehand.
The idea behind them is to offer a snapshot of the voters’ concerns. They are aimed at predicting which party is likely to come to power.
Several news channels and agencies in India conduct exit polls – with varying degrees of success.
As per Business Standard, their accuracy depends on a slew of factors including structured questionnaires, in-person or telephonic interviews of random people for fairness, sample size, demographic representation, data compilation, and count method.
The first exit poll was conducted in 1957 by the Indian Institute of Public Opinion.
The group conducted an exit poll during the second Lok Sabha elections.
As per Hindustan Times, it was the Delhi-based Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) that pioneered in the 1960s.
But it was another two decades before exit polls began being taken seriously in the media.
This is when psephologist Prannoy Roy teamed up with David Butler.
Advertisement Roy, Butler and Ashok Lahiri would go on to publish a landmark book The Compendium of Indian Elections.
State-run Doordarshan asking the CSDS to conduct a countrywide exit poll in 1996 also brought exit polls further into the mainstream.
“Without a structured questionnaire, the data can neither be collected coherently nor be analysed systematically to arrive at vote share estimates,” Indian Express quoted Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) director Sanjay Kumar as saying.
What are the rules for exit polls?
Exit polls are governed by The Representation of People Act, 1951.
Section 126 A of the act restricts publication and dissemination of exit polls results.
Advertisement Exit polls are usually conducted right after voters exit the polls on voting day – as opposed to opinion polls which are conducted beforehand. PTI It states, “No person shall conduct any exit poll and publish or publicise by means of the print or electronic media or disseminate in any other manner, whatsoever, the result of any exit poll during such period, as may be notified by the Election Commission in this regard.”
It adds that in case of a general election, the period may commence from the beginning of the hours fixed for the poll on the first day and continue till half an hour after the closing of the poll in all the States and Union territories.
According to Business Standard, this is done so that exit polls don’t influence voters or voting patterns.
Advertisement Those who violate this provision can be sentenced to a prison term of up to two years, a fine or both.
The Election Commission first issued guidelines on exit polls in 1998. The EC under Article 324 of the Constitution barred newspapers and television news channels from publishing or broadcasting results of opinion and exit polls between 5 pm on 14 February 1998 and 5 pm on 7 March 1998. The first phase in that year’s general elections began on 16 February 1998, and the final phase began on 7 March.
As per Economic Times, the EC in 2022 said news broadcasters must not air any final, formal and definite results &ldquo;until such results are formally announced by the Election Commission of India, unless such results are carried with clear disclaimer that they are unofficial or incomplete or partial results or projections which should not be taken as final results.&rdquo;
Advertisement Why are exit polls relevant?
Because people want to know which party and candidates are likely to win &ndash; and quickly.
However, critics say that they are often left wanting when it comes to accuracy.
According to Business Standard, exit polls are also often condemned for being biased, relying on skewed data or improper sample size, and being sponsored or politically motivated. The Economic Times quoted TK Arun as saying, &ldquo;Exit polls are tricky in India. Indians are prudent people. Why would they tell a pollster anything other than what they figure out the pollster wants to hear?

Why take the risk? Indians can be rational when the issue at stake is lack of faith as well.&rdquo;
In the past, exit polls have had both hits and misses galore.
According to Hindustan Times, except for the 1998 and 2014 polls, at least four Lok Sabha polls have gotten it badly wrong.
This includes two back-to-back predictions in 2004 and 2009.
The 2004 exit polls in particular were a massive failure with the pollsters completely missing the Congress coming back to power as the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA with its ‘India Shining’ slogan lost its majority.
All exit polls predicted a win for the BJP.
Again in 2009, while most pollsters gave the edge to the UPA, they completely missed a huge swing in its favour.
The UPA added 40 more seats to its tally.

While most pollsters said then prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi and the BJP-led NDA would cross the 272 mark, almost none of them forecast the decisive performance.
It was only pollster Chanakya, who predicted 340 seats for the NDA, that came close to getting it spot on.
In 2019, most pollsters predicted that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA government would return &ndash; albeit with a reduced margin compared to the previous election. Of course, we know that the pollsters yet again underestimated the strength of the BJP-led NDA, which would nab 353 seats.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is among the big names that will contest.
Modi will yet again contest from Varanasi – his third time after the 2014 and 2019 polls.
Modi defeated Arvind Kejriwal by a massive margin of 3.37 lakh votes in 2014 and handily beat out the SP-BSP Mahagathbandhan candidate Shalini Yadav in 2019 by an even more impressive margin of 4.80 lakh votes.

"Predictions, predilections, and Indian general elections",https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/predictions-predilections-and-indian-general-elections-13775669.html,Election predictions are notoriously hard due to the changing nature of the parameters,"Predictions are awfully difficult, even with the reassuring crunch of numbers! And yet, they are our fatal predilection, whether the challenge is for our pleasure or for that of others. Be it the stock market, astrology, or gambling, our insatiable curiosity for the mysterious and unknown is probably what propels such abandonment.
Take the ongoing Lok Sabha polls, going on for perhaps too long now, and the concomitant barrage of prophecies from TV channels, from YouTube “influenczars” and from downright bored individuals, all of whom shoot off their incendiary numbers into the tinder of social media. These soothsayers speak from relative ignorance and mostly from a fascination for a particular party, be they pidis or bhakts.They speak with the confidence that they can actually fool all the people all the time, with Abraham Lincoln being the ultimate fool, poor man. What is most horrendous is that all of them have declared random numbers like 180, 200, 250, 272, 303, 320, 362, 370, and the ace of spades, 400, long before all the votes have come in. This is why I liken election predictions in India to gambling. It is matka guessing in a satta bazar. Parrot talk, or tarot talk, it leads to no concrete outcome. It does not affect the choices made by the voters, choices one suspects were cast in stone, long before the elections were even announced. And yet, these delirious djinns persist, as their minds are made up too. The happy side to this sad fantasy is that it is time-bound, and we can all reclaim our normal lives on June 4.
Advertisement Lighter comments aside, there is a more serious side to prediction, based on the assumption that future events are influenced to some or a greater extent by what has happened before. History is our greatest teacher. The art and science of good prediction lie in identifying which past (or present) event will likely influence an event to come. Let us take the Indian monsoon, an annual event of major economic importance to our nation, and one that has just begun this year. It would help the government enormously if it knew a few months in advance if the monsoon were to be normal, below average, or will punch above its weight.
At present, the Indian monsoon is predicted using a combination of atmospheric models, sea surface temperature analysis, historical data, and satellite observations. Key factors include the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, the Indian Ocean Dipole, and wind patterns. Advanced computational models simulate these variables to forecast rainfall and monsoon onset accurately. However, there are totally different methods of monsoon prediction that would not be considered ‘scientific’ by western definition, but are yet chillingly accurate. Traditionally, some Indian communities predict the monsoon by observing the nesting behaviour of certain birds, like the Indian weaver bird (Baya Weaver). It is believed that if these birds build their nests on higher branches, a heavier monsoon will ensue. Conversely, lower nests indicate lighter rainfall. This method relies on the birds&rsquo; instinctive response to environmental cues, and seems to be largely reliable. Nature lovers might like to correlate this occurrence with the Japanese kō or 72 micro-seasons, for further poetic justification.
Advertisement Prediction is a key aspect of science, and the smaller the number of known events, phenomena, and parameters used to predict a large number of future events accurately, the better the value of the prediction. At the risk of introducing an equation in this column, one can say the value of a prediction, V = (N/n) – 1, where one is able to correctly predict N outcomes with n parameters. According to this equation, the value of a prediction is zero if one needs n parameters to predict N outcomes.
Let’s apply this equation to the present Lok Sabha election. We could say that N = 543, in other words, we want to correctly predict the results from 543 constituencies. How many parameters would we need, or what is the value of n, for a good prediction? What our present-day pollsters are doing, in trying to improve the accuracy of their guesses, is to increase the number of parameters to absurd levels. They ask whether all the Muslim women in Kishanganj will vote like their menfolk, whether the hot summer days in Ramagundam will harm voting, or whether all the Gounders in Kovai will stay loyal to the AIADMK. The problem with such micro-parameters is that they cannot be quantified properly. Informal surveys on the ground may not be the answer because all respondents may not answer truthfully. We see ludicrous statements from politicians—some say that low turnouts hurt the BJP, while others say that low turnouts hurt the Congress. Others say that a low or high turnout may help or hurt a party, depending on the state. Still others say that whatever happens, Congress is winning. The problem with any or all of this is that none of it can be either proven or disproven—this makes it non-scientific. The reader will appreciate that as n increases with all these unprovable parameters, the value of the prediction quickly goes to zero. It is easier to say that there is only one parameter in this election, and that is the prime minister himself. Applying the equation, the value of my prediction is (543/1) – 1 = 542, which in practical terms means a sizable majority for the BJP. I think I’m doing pretty well for myself with this prediction. June 4 will tell.
Advertisement What I would have liked to see, and what seems missing, is a more accurate assessment of ‘swing’ constituencies in bellwether states. No expert needs to predict that the BJP will win in Gandhinagar or that it will lose in South Kolkata. On the other hand, if the BJP were to win in Thiruvananthapuram, Bengaluru Rural, Hyderabad, or Central Chennai, this would signify that winds of change are blowing across the country. The very high voter turnout in Baramulla is another pointer. An ability to extrapolate from this to an accurate prediction about the Kashmir Valley in particular and the country in general, is what is missing. Once again, what I would like to see on June 4 is how soon any particular TV channel is able to call the election, say by 9, 10, or 11 am? The sooner it is able to do this, the better its reports will be and the less fluff and bluff.
Advertisement Election predictions are notoriously hard due to the changing nature of the parameters, something we do not usually see in science. The Truman-Dewey US presidential election of 1945, was made memorable by the photograph of the victor, Harry Truman, brandishing a copy of the Chicago Tribune that screamed the wrong headline, “Dewey defeats Truman”. So close was the vote. At the end of World War II, the UK voted against Winston Churchill, their doughty PM, who had saved them from Nazi tyranny. He was hustled out of office when the Labour Party won by a substantial majority. Can we ever imagine a similar situation in India? And yet, some of our own elections have indeed yielded surprising results, and one recollects 1971, 1977, and 2019, when the decisiveness of the mandate was quite something else.

Advertisement Here is a phase-by-phase analysis.
Phase 1: 19 April
In phase 1, out of 1,618 candidates analysed, 252 have criminal cases and 161 serious criminal cases.
According to the ADR, seven candidates face murder charges, while 19 are involved in attempted murder cases. Eighteen candidates have declared cases of crimes against women in their affidavits, with one facing a rape charge under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

Beyond the Lines | Indian elections: What the biggest show on earth can teach the world,https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/beyond-the-lines-indian-elections-what-the-biggest-show-on-earth-can-teach-the-world-13773225.html,"Not only are the Indian general elections the largest poll show on earth — they are also the most intensely contested and certainly, sets the bar for America to follow this November","This was going to be the global election year that decides the fate of the world. This was also going to be the biggest election in the world’s biggest democracy. With over 900 million broadband subscribers, the Indian voter is more plugged into the commentary of the voting analysis, trends and outcomes.
The cacophony of election analysis is hardwired into the heads of Indian citizens through their phones and devices, their choices dictated by opinions and beliefs, which in turn has been an outcome of results seen in the last five years. Yet, when I went to cast my vote this Monday, the booth-level machinery was so well-oiled and efficient that beyond the cacophony of election sloganeering and digital pyrotechnics, the unassuming power of silent citizens dutifully stepping up to vote on their appointed day, sans drama or hyperbole, held up a useful guide for the rest of the world to emulate.
Advertisement India, the world’s most populous democracy, is currently holding its general election over a seven-phase period that continues for seven weeks. Indians can vote between 19 April and 1 June, with the results set to be declared on 4 June.
The World Decides in 2024
Over fifty elections take place in 2024, including some of the most impacting ones such as the US, Russia, India, Taiwan. Fifty-one per cent of the world will either have a new dispensation or continue with the existing one. As elections take place across the world, the festival of democracy in India is expected to be among the keenly contested, fair and well organised ones in the world.
These elections have also proved that India sets consistent standards in choosing their leaders, disproving a biased opinion about democracy and elections that certain western thinking has held towards India. Using a template of a fairness score to evaluate the independence of elections in countries, as a well-known western publication recently did, reduces the process of choices in elections to a rating number which can both end up being biased and patronising, and is dictated by a long-held expectation that Indian polls are simultaneously cantankerous and exotic — a work in progress democracy that promises to be civilised but is never one. It also served to quietly aid a narrative that the democratic processes in the west are superior.
Advertisement Why India’s Free Elections Trumps West’s Bias
Take for instance, the freedom and fairness score accorded to India’s elections, which is 0.53 and compare it to the other nations in their leadup to the elections. Mexico is a country heading for elections this year. In this election cycle, 30 candidates have already been assassinated, according to data from the research firm Laboratorio Electoral. In 2021, 30 candidates were killed while in 2018, the elections saw 24 killings. These elections are expected to be among the most violent. According to western pundits, Mexico has a freedom and fairness score of 0.75 in the conduct of elections, which indicates the elections are more ‘just and fair’ than in India. Parts of western media has been unduly harsh on India, rating its fairness score of elections at 0.53.
Advertisement In Indonesia, the electoral process is still dominated by corrupt or influential leaders who grew powerful during the authoritarian rule of Suharto. Democracy is new, and power oscillated between influential stakeholders, till Joko Widodo, an outsider, broke the stranglehold. Thereafter, a general took over as President — one the west has accused of human rights abuses. Interestingly, Indonesia’s freedom and fairness score stands at 0.68, higher than India. Which means that the credibility of Indian elections is just about better than the banana republics — an assumption that betrays the negative bias of such studies.
The US, rated high in freedom and fairness index by the publication, struggled under serious allegations of tampering and influence by Russia and the subsequent response of Trump supporters laying siege in Washington DC after losing the elections indicated a democracy that was functional but not civilised. On the other hand, far from the history of some of the nations, who have either embraced dysfunctional democracy along the way or seem to be falling by the wayside in terms of their law and order situation in the lead up to the elections, India has maintained an enviable record of holding free and fair elections over seven decades.
Advertisement The Decisive Indian Vote
From the general election held in 1951-52 in which 17.5 crore Indians, voted in the elections to the 18th Lok Sabha that are under way, the process has evolved and matured along with Indian democracy over the decades. So have the voters graduated, from being largely illiterate to being well informed and technically savvy while making choices.
The CEC explained why the voluntary nature of casting votes means that the ECI operates ‘in an entirely persuasive space, inviting the citizens to volunteer to become part of the electoral roll and, thereafter, through systematic voter awareness programmes, motivates them to exercise their franchise.’ There is a high elector to population ratio which underpins the discipline, patience and belief that Indian voters have demonstrated in executing the process. The power of Indian elections demonstrates a growing, emerging India that is willing and ready to show how democracy is a proven political system in this world. Take for instance the example of Jammu and Kashmir.
Advertisement Since 1989, all earlier elections in the region had been plagued by violence and a tendence towards anarchy, influenced by separatist parties. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Anantnag, Srinagar and Baramulla — the Lok Sabha seats — recorded dismal attendance.
Baramulla recorded 46 per cent voting in 1996. Thereafter it has struggled to have voters on election days. Twenty-eight years later, 59 per cent of Baramulla showed up to vote on polling day, breaking the previous record.
This time, local political leaders have addressed large crowds who are keen to be a part of the time-tested process of democracy and express their opinions at the poll booths, unlike earlier times when boycotts dominated Kashmiri elections and the turnout, cowed down by the gun, often struggled to crawl out of single digit percentage attendance.
The resolve to bring Kashmir out of a rut of decades-old militancy by taking the gun out of the equation has helped locals trust the power of the ballot in making lives better instead of being ruled by fear of militancy. There is a growing curiosity about the choices available in a democracy through the power of the ballot, which many people in the state now see value in, unlike across the border where democracy is in shambles and offers no choices.
Younger India: 18 Million First-Time Voters
One of the key aspects in these elections is the addition of over 2-crore young first time voters. These voters, in each successive edition, are going to boost a voting population that consumes digital information and has a strong sense of independent opinion. A keen interest among young voters has led to parties canvassing through digital platforms. An increasingly politically conscious, intelligent but less patient voter base has meant that parties have had to address more matured issues – which also tells us how India has travelled a fair distance from the days when Garibi Hatao was a dominating slogan.
The voter turnout, lower in the early stages, yet reflects an involved participation of its citizens across the country. In a country where different belief systems have held sway, the one common space where India comes together as a country is its general election. Which is why, an election season resembles a festival of choices rather than a mere mechanical process of choosing.
India Votes for the World to Emulate
In the previous national edition in 2019, the Election Commission confirmed a 67 per cent turnout. The Americans were marginally higher in the same period while voting in their elections. The Indian elections have also been among the most expensive elections, in which political parties spent more than 7 billion in 2019, higher than the spends in the US elections in that period. Not only are the Indian general elections the largest poll show on earth — they are also the most intensely contested and certainly, sets the bar for America to follow this November.
While wars and conflicts singe the world in most parts and certain nations have gone berserk losing their way while making choices, India proves yet again that this election festival of citizens is not only the biggest but also the most civilised and sane process on earth.

"Busy dousing fire on Swati Maliwal 'assault' row, AAP loses a week of Kejriwal's freedom and fought against itself than rivals",https://www.firstpost.com/india/busy-dousing-fire-on-swati-maliwal-assault-row-aap-loses-a-week-of-kejriwals-freedom-and-fought-against-itself-than-rivals-13772369.html,"Amid the escalating blame game, the focus abruptly moved from Arvind Kejriwal to Swati Maliwal and the internal feud between Maliwal and other AAP members overshadowed Kejriwal&rsquo;s continuous attacks on the prime minister and the BJP","When the Supreme Court granted interim bail to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on 10 May until 2 June, the AAP leader had a clear agenda ahead. Arrested on 21 March by the Enforcement Directorate in the liquor policy case, Kejriwal now had 21 days to capitalise on his temporary release. His primary focus would have been to generate publicity for himself and the AAP by intensifying his criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP.
Advertisement The Maliwal incident: A shift in focus
This situation progressed smoothly until the Swati Maliwal incident on 13 May. On that day, AAP Rajya Sabha MP Swati Maliwal accused Bibhav Kumar, a member of Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal&rsquo;s personal staff of misconduct. Following her allegations, the Delhi Police arrested Kejriwal&rsquo;s private assistant Bibhav Kumar, igniting a dual conflict: AAP versus BJP and Swati Maliwal versus the rest of AAP.
Amid the escalating blame game, two significant shifts occurred. First, the focus abruptly moved from Arvind Kejriwal to Swati Maliwal. Second, the internal feud between Maliwal and other AAP members overshadowed Kejriwal&rsquo;s continuous attacks on the prime minister and the BJP.
Significantly, this incident consumed a crucial portion of Kejriwal&rsquo;s 21 days of freedom with an entire week diverted to the Maliwal controversy.
Strategic reorientation
Regardless of whether AAP inadvertently fell into a trap or recognised the situation belatedly, Kejriwal understood the pressing need to redirect attention back to himself. He needed to refocus the battle onto BJP territory and distance the party from the Maliwal incident. Whether it was genuine support for his long-time aide Kumar or a strategy to revitalise AAP, the Delhi chief minister knew that a significant move was necessary to reclaim the spotlight.
What better way to do it than challenge Prime Minister Modi to arrest all AAP leaders as he announced on Saturday that he would march to BJP headquarters in Delhi on Sunday at noon accompanied by all the prominent leaders of his party. More the chaos better the publicity.
Advertisement Kejriwal alleged that the BJP was trying to completely destroy AAP through Operation Jhadu. He shared that people who were familiar with both the BJP and him had informed him that Prime Minister Modi acknowledged AAP&rsquo;s growing influence and the global discussion around their work. Kejriwal said that the BJP saw AAP as a potential tough challenger in several states and wanted to eliminate them. He made these statements while addressing the press at the party office on Sunday.
Importance of Delhi for AAP
Voting for all seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi is scheduled for 25 May as part of Phase 6 of the polling.
Advertisement Delhi is of paramount importance to the AAP for several reasons. It is the party&rsquo;s primary base and stronghold where it was founded and first achieved significant political success by winning the Delhi Legislative Assembly elections in 2013. Maintaining control over Delhi is essential for AAP&rsquo;s political legitimacy and influence. Furthermore, Delhi serves as a showcase for AAP&rsquo;s governance model and policies.
AAP finds itself grappling with the challenge of maintaining a focussed engagement with its diverse electorate in Delhi, which encompasses various socioeconomic groups. Amid its efforts to highlight flagship programmes such as mohalla clinics, subsidised electricity and its work in government schools, the controversy surrounding Maliwal has diverted public attention from these areas which AAP would have wanted to bring in front of the voters.
Advertisement Whether the Maliwal incident is indeed a premeditated attack on AAP as the party alleges or simply a coincidence only time will reveal. However, there is no doubt that it has placed AAP in a defensive position precisely when it was gearing up for a strong offensive. Whether it&rsquo;s a calculated move by a political mastermind or just an unfortunate stroke of fate remains uncertain for now.

The apex court granted the Delhi chief minister bail in the alleged money laundering case in order to campaign for the Lok Sabha polls.
But the controversy over Swati Maliwal has dogged Kejriwal at every step.
Maliwal, the AAP&rsquo;s Rajya Sabha MP, filed an FIR on Thursday accusing the Delhi chief minister&rsquo;s aide Bibhav Kumar of assaulting her. Advertisement The AAP has alleged a conspiracy is being hatched against Kejriwal, while the BJP has demanded stringent action against the accused.
Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at how the row has disrupted his campaign:
Kejriwal&rsquo;s release from jail was a big boost to the party and the Opposition.
The Times of India quoted Sandeep Pathak, a close aide of Kejriwal who is overseeing the AAP Lok Sabha campaign, as saying the development breathed fresh life into the party.
&ldquo;With him, the cadre feels happier, much more positive, much more charged. That’s one aspect of it. The other is that the BJP thought that they would get Kejriwal arrested and then start breaking up the AAP in Delhi and Punjab. But they miserably failed,&rdquo; the AAP Rajya Sabha MP said.
But Maliwal&rsquo;s accusations have now cast a pall over proceedings.
&ldquo;While the whole truth is not out yet, all is certainly not well inside the AAP. There have been reports of differences between Kejriwal and Maliwal for some time. There are claims that Kejriwal was not happy with Maliwal&rsquo;s absence from Delhi before and after his arrest as well as her relative silence on his arrest. Maliwal, however, was reportedly visiting her sister in the US,&rdquo; the piece stated.
It noted that if Kejriwal is sent to jail again for a long time, the party is likely to fracture. But if he is granted regular bail, he will likely be able to keep his team together.
&ldquo;What was supposed to be a few weeks of respite for Kejriwal are proving to be a testing period. His attention will now be divided between the election campaign and the party affairs,&rdquo; the piece noted.
Advertisement On Wednesday some people also raised slogans during Kejriwal&rsquo;s road show in Chandni Chowk against Kumar, as per The Times of India.
&lsquo;Slapped, hit in stomach&rsquo;
Maliwal in her FIR filed Thursday claimed she was &ldquo;slapped, hit in the stomach and kicked&rdquo; by Kumar.
The FIR was registered after Maliwal&rsquo;s statement was recorded by a two-member team led by Additional Commissioner of Police P.S. Kushwaha.
The team was at Maliwal&rsquo;s residence in central Delhi for nearly four and a half hours.
AAP Rajya Sabha MP Swati Maliwal has accused Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal&rsquo;s aide of assault. PTI File Photo Maliwal claimed she ran out of the CM&rsquo;s residence and called the police immediately after the incident.
Kejriwal was present at his residence when the incident took place, she added.
Advertisement Maliwal broke down several times while giving the statement and sought strict action against Kumar.
The AAP MP on Thursday underwent medical check-up at All India Institute of Medical Sciences.
Kejriwal evades question, BJP attacks
Adding fuel to the fire, Kejriwal on Wednesday did not address Maliwal&rsquo;s allegations during a press conference.
Kejriwal, flanked by Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav and AAP Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh, evaded a question on the subject.
Singh, however, said his party has already made its stand clear on the issue.

&mdash; ANI (@ANI) May 16, 2024 Advertisement Singh, who had met Maliwal at her residence on Wednesday, said, &ldquo;The AAP is our family. Party has made its view clear.&rdquo;
He also targeted the BJP government at the Centre by raising the issue of a Manipuri woman being paraded naked, the Prajwal Revanna sex scandal and Maliwal being &ldquo;beaten up&rdquo; by police during protests by wrestlers when she was the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) chief.
Advertisement &ldquo;I want that BJP and PM should also answer on the issues I have kept before you. He (PM) should answer on the issue of Swati Maliwal, who was dragged and beaten when she went to seek justice for the female wrestlers. I just want to say don&rsquo;t play political games on the issues,&rdquo; he said.
Yadav then took the microphone and said &ldquo;there are more important things than that&rdquo;.
Then, unfolding a piece of paper, he added, &ldquo;BJP people are not with anyone, it is a &lsquo;gang&rsquo; that lodges false cases&rdquo;.
Singh at a press conference on Tuesday had accepted that Kumar had &ldquo;misbehaved&rdquo; with Maliwal.
He also labelled the incident &lsquo;highly condemnable&rsquo;, as per The Times of India.
BJP national spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia claimed that Kejriwal is the main &ldquo;criminal&rdquo; in the complaint that his aide Kumar had physically attacked Maliwal at the chief minister&rsquo;s residence, as he cited the telephone call she had made to the Delhi Police to report the matter.
&ldquo;His (Kejriwal) silence speaks a lot. Out of jail, he is more a &lsquo;goonda&rsquo; than a chief minister,&rdquo; he told reporters, noting that Kumar was seen with the chief minister in Lucknow.
Stringent action should be taken against the accused in the case, he said.
Kumar, he noted, was photographed with Kejriwal during his visit to Lucknow.
On Friday, the Delhi BJP Mahila Morcha members staged a protest near Kejriwal&rsquo;s residence.
Led by Mahila Morcha president Richa Pandey Mishra, the protesters, who were carrying bangles, demanded Kejriwal&rsquo;s resignation.
Mishra said the Mahila Morcha wanted to hand over the bangles to Kejriwal for keeping mum over the incident with Maliwal that occurred at his official residence.
“Arvind Kejriwal should be ashamed. He should resign from his post and apologise to the country. Swati Maliwal should get justice,&quot; a Mahila Morcha member told PTI.
The Mahila Morcha of the Delhi BJP also extended support to Maliwal, writing a letter to her saying the incident was a matter of honour of women in the country.
A team of the Delhi Police also turned up at Kejriwal&rsquo;s residence on Friday, as per India Today.
&lsquo;BJP conspiracy to frame Kejirwal&rsquo;
Meanwhile, the AAP has claimed the case is a &lsquo;BJP conspiracy to frame Kejriwal.&rsquo;
Senior AAP leader Atishi at a press conference said, &ldquo;Today a video has surfaced that has exposed the lie of Maliwal. In her FIR, she has said she was brutally assaulted and she was in pain, and buttons of her shirt were torn. A video that has surfaced shows an entirely different reality.&rdquo;
Atishi said the video shows Maliwal &ldquo;comfortably sitting in the drawing room&rdquo; and &ldquo;threatening the security staff&rdquo;, and that &ldquo;her clothes were not torn&rdquo;.
&ldquo;The video shows her threatening Kumar. The charges levelled by Maliwal are baseless. Maliwal insisted on meeting Kejriwal. She is Rajya Sabha MP and she should know that the CM has a busy schedule. Kumar told her that the chief minister is busy and unable to meet her. She shouted at him, pushed him and tried to enter the residential portion of the CM House,&rdquo; she claimed.
&ldquo;The whole incident proves that it was a BJP conspiracy and Swati Maliwal was made its face to frame Kejriwal,&rdquo; she alleged.
Asked about Singh accepting misbehaviour with Maliwal, Atishi said, &ldquo;AAP MP Sanjay Singh met Maliwal and he had only her version. But now this video has brought out the truth.&rdquo;

Here&rsquo;s what the News18 exit poll has predicted for the NDA and the INDI Alliance in some of the big states,"The voting for the Lok Sabha elections has come to an end and it’s been a lengthy process — seven long phases spread over six weeks. Now, it’s time to shift attention to the results. Before the results are announced on 4 June, here’s what the exit polls reveal.
Most exit polls are predicting a return of the Narendra Modi-led NDA government, winning over 350 seats, with the Opposition’s INDI Alliance managing somewhere between 125 and 150. News18 conducted its own mega exit poll, according to which NDA has bagged 355-370 seats, while the INDI Alliance has won 125-140 seats.
Advertisement But how has the NDA fared against the INDI Alliance in each state? We break through the clutter and present the results of the News18 mega exit poll in quick, easy graphics.
NORTH
The NDA, as per News18&rsquo;s exit poll, will continue its dominance in the north. In Uttar Pradesh, the NDA is poised to win 68-71 of the 80 seats, while the INDI Alliance is predicted to win nine-12 seats.
In Bihar, the NDA, of which Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s JDU is a part, will be bagging 31-34 seats, while INDI Alliance is believed to get six-nine seats. Delhi and Haryana is all about the NDA once again.
SOUTH
In the South, it seems a Narendra Modi-led push has helped the BJP. Exit polls predict an improved performance of the BJP in the five southern states. It seems in Andhra Pradesh, the alliance with Chandrababu Naidu-led Telugu Desam Party has paid big dividends for the BJP, with the NDA emerging on top. In Telangana, the News18 exit poll gives BJP a big reason to smile, predicting the party to win seven-10 seats, compared to Congress’ five-eight.
Karnataka is also expected to vote overwhelmingly for the BJP, despite its preference for the Congress at the state level. In Tamil Nadu, the party is even expected to make a debut, securing between one-three seats, exit polls predict.
Advertisement The Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) is set to sweep Kerala once, while the BJP-led NDA will open its account in the southern state.
EAST
The News18 exit poll predicts that the BJP-led NDA will build on its 2019 performance in the east. In West Bengal, the BJP seems to be the biggest winner, with the Mamata Banerjee led TMC trailing behind. And in Assam, it&rsquo;s NDA all the way, predicted to win 10-13 seats.
Another big surprise is from the state of Odisha. The exit poll has predicted a clean sweep for the BJP. The poll predicts the BJP will win 13-15 seats, with the BJD to come in second with six-eight seats.
Advertisement WEST
In the West, the BJP-led NDA is predicted to be the big winner as per the exit poll. Gujarat is the big news here with the NDA set to be sweeping all 26 seats. Meanwhile, in Maharashtra, the NDA is predicted to win 32-35 seats, with the INDI Alliance winning 15-18 seats.
In Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, it&rsquo;s all about the NDA once again. The News18 exit poll predicts 26-29 seats for the NDA out of the 29 seats. In Rajasthan, the NDA is predicted to win 18-25 seats.

But how did they fare in 2014 and 2019? Which pollster got it right and which missed the mark?","Voting for the seventh and final phase of the Lok Sabha polls concluded today.
Now, with the counting of votes scheduled for 4 June, all eyes are on the exit polls. The exit polls have been released at 6.30 pm.
This is in line with the Section 126A of the Representation of the People’s Act, 1951, which states that exit polls can only be aired half an hour after the completion of the final phase of voting.
Advertisement But what did they predict in 2014 and 2019? And how accurate are exit polls really?
Let’s take a closer look:
2014
Going into 2014, pollsters were under some pressure.
After all, the exit polls had failed to get it right in back-to-back Lok Sabha elections.
In 2004, the polls predicated that the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA, which was relying on the ‘India shining’ campaign, would win big.
However, the Congress made a huge comeback in 2004.
In 2009, the exit polls predicted the UPA would get the most seats, but that the result would be a hung Parliament.
The Congress-led coalition defied the odds yet again with the Grand Old Party itself getting 200 seats.
In 2014, all the exit polls favoured the BJP-led NDA under Narendra Modi.
For NDA
The News24-Chanakya poll predicted that the NDA would nab 340 seats, while the India Today-Cicero poll gave the coalition 272 seats. The CNN-IBN-CSDS said the alliance would win 280 seats, while the Times Now poll gave the NDA.
The ABP News-Nielsen predicted 274 seats for the NDA, while the NDTV-Hansa Research estimated 279 seats for the NDA.
For UPA
For the UPA, the India Today-Cicero pollster predicted 115 seats, while News 24-Chanakya estimated 101 seats. The CNN-IBN-CSDS gave the alliance 97 seats, while Times Now projected 148 seats.
Advertisement The ABP News-Nielsen said the UPA would win 97 seats, while NDTV-Hansa Research said the alliance would net 103 seats.
Pollsters seemed to underestimate the hunger for change in the public mind as well as the sheer scale of the NDA’s victory and the UPA’s defeat.
Of all the pollsters, the News24-Chanakya was most on the money.
Advertisement The NDA would go on to win a massive 336 seats with the BJP itself crossing the half-way mark in Parliament and netting 282 seats.
The UPA, on the other hand, would be reduced to just 60 seats with the Congress winning 44 seats by its lonesome.
2019 polls
In 2019, most pollsters predicted that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA government would return – albeit with a reduced margin.
For NDA
The India Today-Axis pollster predicted that the NDA would win between 339 and 365 seats, while the News 24-Today’s Chanakya gave the alliance 350 seats.
The News18-IPSOS poll said the NDA would net 336 seats, while Times Now-VMR predicted 306 seats for the NDA.
The India TV-CNX pollster estimated 300 seats for the alliance, while the Sudarshan News poll gave the NDA 305 seats.
Advertisement For UPA
Meanwhile, for the UPA, the India Today-Axi poll predicted between 77 and 108 seats, while the News 24-Today’s Chanakya estimated 95 seats.
The News18-IPSOS poll said the UPA would win 82 seats, while the Times Now-VMR poll gave the alliance 132 seats.
The India TV-CNX predicted 120 seats for the UPA, while Sudarshan News estimated the alliance would net 124 seats.
The India Today-Axis gave the UPA between 77 and 108 seats, while News 24-Today’s Chanakya predicted 95 seats.
Most of the pollsters yet again failed to gauge the popularity of the BJP-led NDA.
Advertisement The NDA, incredibly, ended up bettering its 2014 tally in a resounding vote of confidence in Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The alliance won 352 seats with the BJP itself winning 303 seats.
Meanwhile, the Congress-led UPA expanded its tally to 91 seats with the grand old party winning 52 seats – but it was nothing to write home about.
The News 24-Today’s Chanakya was yet again the most accurate pollster.
Are exit polls accurate?
Not necessarily.
As noted above, pollsters have been off the mark with remarkable frequency in at least four recent Lok Sabha elections including 2004 and 2009.
Exit polls are also often condemned for being biased, relying on skewed data or improper sample size, and being sponsored or politically motivated, Business Standard.
The Economic Times quoted TK Arun as saying, “Exit polls are tricky in India. Indians are prudent people. Why would they tell a pollster anything other than what they figure out the pollster wants to hear? Suppose he voted Congress, and says so to the pollster, the BJP wins the election and extracts from pollsters details of all those who said they voted Congress, what mayhem might not follow? Why take the risk? Indians can be rational when the issue at stake is lack of faith as well.”
In short, exit polls can be hazardous to a political junkie’s health.

Lok Sabha Election 2024: How are exit polls conducted and are they accurate?,https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-are-exit-polls-conducted-how-accurate-are-exit-polls-lok-sabha-elections-2024-exit-polls-general-elections-13777162.html,"The largest democratic exercise in the world, India&rsquo;s 18th Lok Sabha Elections, concludes today. Following the 44-day electoral process, exit polls will commence, providing predictions on the likely victors and the extent of their triumph. What are these polls? Do they always get it right?","India&rsquo;s 18th Lok Sabha Elections, the largest democratic exercise on the planet, will conclude on 1 June, 2024 as the seventh phase comes to a close . As the lengthy 44-day electoral process ends, attention will shift to exit polls, which are expected to provide insights into the election outcomes starting from 6:30 pm on 1 June.
Exit polls are crucial for gauging the mood of the electorate and predicting the likely winners before the official results are declared. However, their accuracy and methodology are often subjects of debate and scrutiny.
Advertisement What is the methodology behind exit polls?
Exit polls are conducted by surveying voters immediately after they cast their votes. This method contrasts with opinion polls, which are conducted before the elections to gather voters&rsquo; views on various issues and candidates. Exit polls aim to provide a snapshot of voting trends, influenced by various factors such as issues, personalities, and party loyalties.
The methodology of exit polls involves interviewing voters outside polling stations using a structured questionnaire. This approach relies on the voters&rsquo; recent experiences, increasing the likelihood of obtaining accurate responses.

AP The data collected is then analysed to estimate vote shares and predict seat outcomes. These polls are typically conducted by private firms or media organisations rather than government agencies.
How has technology changed conducting exit polls?
Technological advancements have significantly influenced the conduct of exit polls. Techniques such as call-backs to respondents, images of interviews being conducted, phone calls from the field, and WhatsApp groups have enhanced data collection and analysis.
Despite these advancements, ensuring the accuracy of predictions remains challenging due to the complex and diverse nature of the Indian electorate.

AP Structured questionnaires are vital for coherent data collection and systematic analysis, reported Indian Express. The Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) emphasises the importance of representative samples in ensuring accurate predictions. A large sample size is crucial, but the representativeness of the sample is equally important.
Advertisement What challenges are faced while conducting exit polls?
Estimating vote shares and predicting seat outcomes are the primary challenges in conducting exit polls. The swing model, which relies on past election results, is influenced by various factors such as geographic location, caste, religion, and economic class.
Changes in political alliances between elections can also affect predictions. The prediction process is labour-intensive and time-consuming, as it involves making estimates for each seat.

AP The complexity of swings increases with the number of political players. For example, the BJP and JD(U) alliance in Bihar poses a challenge for the swing model. Over- or under-representation of diverse voter sections can impact the accuracy of estimates.
Advertisement How accurate are exit polls?
The accuracy of exit polls depends on various factors beyond sample size. The representativeness of the sample, the methodology used, and the ability to account for diverse voter profiles are critical. Some agencies rely on innovative methods, such as eliminating certain constituencies from the poll, to improve accuracy.
Also Read: Predictions, predilections, and Indian general elections For instance, the Lokniti-CSDS uses post-poll surveys with large sample sizes but echoes the need for representative samples. Their predictions have varied in accuracy, highlighting the complexities involved in electoral predictions.
Have exit polls ever got it wrong?
Historically, exit polls have had mixed accuracy. Some notable instances where exit polls diverged significantly from actual results include:
Advertisement 2004 Lok Sabha Elections: Exit polls predicted a majority for the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA government. However, the actual results saw the NDA falling short of expectations.
Delhi Assembly Elections 2015: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) secured a sweeping victory with 67 out of 70 seats, which was underestimated by exit polls.
Bihar Assembly Elections 2015: Exit polls predicted a close race, but the RJD-JDU-Congress coalition won decisively.
UP Assembly Elections 2017: Despite exit polls predicting a hung assembly, the BJP won over 300 seats.
2014 Lok Sabha Elections: Exit polls did not foresee the BJP achieving an outright majority, which it did by crossing the 272-mark on its own.
In India, exit polls are regulated under Section 126A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. This section prohibits the conduct and publication of exit polls during the polling period to avoid influencing voters.

Why are exit polls released after all votes are cast?

What are they?
Exit polls are essentially quick interviews with voters.
They are usually conducted right after voters exit the polls on voting day – as opposed to opinion polls which are conducted beforehand.
The idea behind them is to offer a snapshot of the voters’ concerns. They are aimed at predicting which party is likely to come to power.
Several news channels and agencies in India conduct exit polls – with varying degrees of success.
As per Business Standard, their accuracy depends on a slew of factors including structured questionnaires, in-person or telephonic interviews of random people for fairness, sample size, demographic representation, data compilation, and count method.
The first exit poll was conducted in 1957 by the Indian Institute of Public Opinion.
The group conducted an exit poll during the second Lok Sabha elections.
As per Hindustan Times, it was the Delhi-based Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) that pioneered in the 1960s.
But it was another two decades before exit polls began being taken seriously in the media.
This is when psephologist Prannoy Roy teamed up with David Butler.
Advertisement Roy, Butler and Ashok Lahiri would go on to publish a landmark book The Compendium of Indian Elections.
State-run Doordarshan asking the CSDS to conduct a countrywide exit poll in 1996 also brought exit polls further into the mainstream.
“Without a structured questionnaire, the data can neither be collected coherently nor be analysed systematically to arrive at vote share estimates,” Indian Express quoted Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) director Sanjay Kumar as saying.
What are the rules for exit polls?
Exit polls are governed by The Representation of People Act, 1951.
Section 126 A of the act restricts publication and dissemination of exit polls results.
Advertisement Exit polls are usually conducted right after voters exit the polls on voting day – as opposed to opinion polls which are conducted beforehand. PTI It states, “No person shall conduct any exit poll and publish or publicise by means of the print or electronic media or disseminate in any other manner, whatsoever, the result of any exit poll during such period, as may be notified by the Election Commission in this regard.”
It adds that in case of a general election, the period may commence from the beginning of the hours fixed for the poll on the first day and continue till half an hour after the closing of the poll in all the States and Union territories.
According to Business Standard, this is done so that exit polls don’t influence voters or voting patterns.
Advertisement Those who violate this provision can be sentenced to a prison term of up to two years, a fine or both.
The Election Commission first issued guidelines on exit polls in 1998. The EC under Article 324 of the Constitution barred newspapers and television news channels from publishing or broadcasting results of opinion and exit polls between 5 pm on 14 February 1998 and 5 pm on 7 March 1998. The first phase in that year’s general elections began on 16 February 1998, and the final phase began on 7 March.
As per Economic Times, the EC in 2022 said news broadcasters must not air any final, formal and definite results &ldquo;until such results are formally announced by the Election Commission of India, unless such results are carried with clear disclaimer that they are unofficial or incomplete or partial results or projections which should not be taken as final results.&rdquo;
Advertisement Why are exit polls relevant?
Because people want to know which party and candidates are likely to win &ndash; and quickly.
However, critics say that they are often left wanting when it comes to accuracy.
According to Business Standard, exit polls are also often condemned for being biased, relying on skewed data or improper sample size, and being sponsored or politically motivated. The Economic Times quoted TK Arun as saying, &ldquo;Exit polls are tricky in India. Indians are prudent people. Why would they tell a pollster anything other than what they figure out the pollster wants to hear? Suppose he voted Congress, and says so to the pollster, the BJP wins the election and extracts from pollsters details of all those who said they voted Congress, what mayhem might not follow? Why take the risk? Indians can be rational when the issue at stake is lack of faith as well.&rdquo;
In the past, exit polls have had both hits and misses galore.
According to Hindustan Times, except for the 1998 and 2014 polls, at least four Lok Sabha polls have gotten it badly wrong.
This includes two back-to-back predictions in 2004 and 2009.
The 2004 exit polls in particular were a massive failure with the pollsters completely missing the Congress coming back to power as the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA with its ‘India Shining’ slogan lost its majority.
All exit polls predicted a win for the BJP.
Again in 2009, while most pollsters gave the edge to the UPA, they completely missed a huge swing in its favour.
The UPA added 40 more seats to its tally.
A man looks at a television screen showing exit poll results after the last phase of the general election in Ahmedabad on 19 May 2019. File photo/Reuters In 2014, the BJP won over 330 seats.
While most pollsters said then prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi and the BJP-led NDA would cross the 272 mark, almost none of them forecast the decisive performance.
It was only pollster Chanakya, who predicted 340 seats for the NDA, that came close to getting it spot on.
In 2019, most pollsters predicted that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA government would return &ndash; albeit with a reduced margin compared to the previous election. Of course, we know that the pollsters yet again underestimated the strength of the BJP-led NDA, which would nab 353 seats.

"Predictions, predilections, and Indian general elections",https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/predictions-predilections-and-indian-general-elections-13775669.html,Election predictions are notoriously hard due to the changing nature of the parameters,"Predictions are awfully difficult, even with the reassuring crunch of numbers! And yet, they are our fatal predilection, whether the challenge is for our pleasure or for that of others. Be it the stock market, astrology, or gambling, our insatiable curiosity for the mysterious and unknown is probably what propels such abandonment.
Take the ongoing Lok Sabha polls, going on for perhaps too long now, and the concomitant barrage of prophecies from TV channels, from YouTube “influenczars” and from downright bored individuals, all of whom shoot off their incendiary numbers into the tinder of social media. These soothsayers speak from relative ignorance and mostly from a fascination for a particular party, be they pidis or bhakts.They speak with the confidence that they can actually fool all the people all the time, with Abraham Lincoln being the ultimate fool, poor man. What is most horrendous is that all of them have declared random numbers like 180, 200, 250, 272, 303, 320, 362, 370, and the ace of spades, 400, long before all the votes have come in. This is why I liken election predictions in India to gambling. It is matka guessing in a satta bazar. Parrot talk, or tarot talk, it leads to no concrete outcome. It does not affect the choices made by the voters, choices one suspects were cast in stone, long before the elections were even announced. And yet, these delirious djinns persist, as their minds are made up too. The happy side to this sad fantasy is that it is time-bound, and we can all reclaim our normal lives on June 4.
Advertisement Lighter comments aside, there is a more serious side to prediction, based on the assumption that future events are influenced to some or a greater extent by what has happened before. History is our greatest teacher. The art and science of good prediction lie in identifying which past (or present) event will likely influence an event to come. Let us take the Indian monsoon, an annual event of major economic importance to our nation, and one that has just begun this year. It would help the government enormously if it knew a few months in advance if the monsoon were to be normal, below average, or will punch above its weight.
At present, the Indian monsoon is predicted using a combination of atmospheric models, sea surface temperature analysis, historical data, and satellite observations. Key factors include the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, the Indian Ocean Dipole, and wind patterns. Advanced computational models simulate these variables to forecast rainfall and monsoon onset accurately. However, there are totally different methods of monsoon prediction that would not be considered ‘scientific’ by western definition, but are yet chillingly accurate. Traditionally, some Indian communities predict the monsoon by observing the nesting behaviour of certain birds, like the Indian weaver bird (Baya Weaver). It is believed that if these birds build their nests on higher branches, a heavier monsoon will ensue. Conversely, lower nests indicate lighter rainfall. This method relies on the birds&rsquo; instinctive response to environmental cues, and seems to be largely reliable. Nature lovers might like to correlate this occurrence with the Japanese kō or 72 micro-seasons, for further poetic justification.
Advertisement Prediction is a key aspect of science, and the smaller the number of known events, phenomena, and parameters used to predict a large number of future events accurately, the better the value of the prediction. At the risk of introducing an equation in this column, one can say the value of a prediction, V = (N/n) – 1, where one is able to correctly predict N outcomes with n parameters. According to this equation, the value of a prediction is zero if one needs n parameters to predict N outcomes.
Let’s apply this equation to the present Lok Sabha election. We could say that N = 543, in other words, we want to correctly predict the results from 543 constituencies. How many parameters would we need, or what is the value of n, for a good prediction? What our present-day pollsters are doing, in trying to improve the accuracy of their guesses, is to increase the number of parameters to absurd levels. They ask whether all the Muslim women in Kishanganj will vote like their menfolk, whether the hot summer days in Ramagundam will harm voting, or whether all the Gounders in Kovai will stay loyal to the AIADMK. The problem with such micro-parameters is that they cannot be quantified properly. Informal surveys on the ground may not be the answer because all respondents may not answer truthfully. We see ludicrous statements from politicians—some say that low turnouts hurt the BJP, while others say that low turnouts hurt the Congress. Others say that a low or high turnout may help or hurt a party, depending on the state. Still others say that whatever happens, Congress is winning. The problem with any or all of this is that none of it can be either proven or disproven—this makes it non-scientific. The reader will appreciate that as n increases with all these unprovable parameters, the value of the prediction quickly goes to zero. It is easier to say that there is only one parameter in this election, and that is the prime minister himself. Applying the equation, the value of my prediction is (543/1) – 1 = 542, which in practical terms means a sizable majority for the BJP. I think I’m doing pretty well for myself with this prediction. June 4 will tell.
Advertisement What I would have liked to see, and what seems missing, is a more accurate assessment of ‘swing’ constituencies in bellwether states. No expert needs to predict that the BJP will win in Gandhinagar or that it will lose in South Kolkata. On the other hand, if the BJP were to win in Thiruvananthapuram, Bengaluru Rural, Hyderabad, or Central Chennai, this would signify that winds of change are blowing across the country. The very high voter turnout in Baramulla is another pointer. An ability to extrapolate from this to an accurate prediction about the Kashmir Valley in particular and the country in general, is what is missing. Once again, what I would like to see on June 4 is how soon any particular TV channel is able to call the election, say by 9, 10, or 11 am? The sooner it is able to do this, the better its reports will be and the less fluff and bluff.
Advertisement Election predictions are notoriously hard due to the changing nature of the parameters, something we do not usually see in science. The Truman-Dewey US presidential election of 1945, was made memorable by the photograph of the victor, Harry Truman, brandishing a copy of the Chicago Tribune that screamed the wrong headline, “Dewey defeats Truman”. So close was the vote. At the end of World War II, the UK voted against Winston Churchill, their doughty PM, who had saved them from Nazi tyranny. He was hustled out of office when the Labour Party won by a substantial majority. Can we ever imagine a similar situation in India? And yet, some of our own elections have indeed yielded surprising results, and one recollects 1971, 1977, and 2019, when the decisiveness of the mandate was quite something else.

Advertisement Here is a phase-by-phase analysis.
Phase 1: 19 April
In phase 1, out of 1,618 candidates analysed, 252 have criminal cases and 161 serious criminal cases.
According to the ADR, seven candidates face murder charges, while 19 are involved in attempted murder cases. Eighteen candidates have declared cases of crimes against women in their affidavits, with one facing a rape charge under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

Beyond the Lines | Indian elections: What the biggest show on earth can teach the world,https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/beyond-the-lines-indian-elections-what-the-biggest-show-on-earth-can-teach-the-world-13773225.html,"Not only are the Indian general elections the largest poll show on earth — they are also the most intensely contested and certainly, sets the bar for America to follow this November","This was going to be the global election year that decides the fate of the world. This was also going to be the biggest election in the world’s biggest democracy. With over 900 million broadband subscribers, the Indian voter is more plugged into the commentary of the voting analysis, trends and outcomes.
The cacophony of election analysis is hardwired into the heads of Indian citizens through their phones and devices, their choices dictated by opinions and beliefs, which in turn has been an outcome of results seen in the last five years. Yet, when I went to cast my vote this Monday, the booth-level machinery was so well-oiled and efficient that beyond the cacophony of election sloganeering and digital pyrotechnics, the unassuming power of silent citizens dutifully stepping up to vote on their appointed day, sans drama or hyperbole, held up a useful guide for the rest of the world to emulate.
Advertisement India, the world’s most populous democracy, is currently holding its general election over a seven-phase period that continues for seven weeks. Indians can vote between 19 April and 1 June, with the results set to be declared on 4 June.
The World Decides in 2024
Over fifty elections take place in 2024, including some of the most impacting ones such as the US, Russia, India, Taiwan. Fifty-one per cent of the world will either have a new dispensation or continue with the existing one. As elections take place across the world, the festival of democracy in India is expected to be among the keenly contested, fair and well organised ones in the world.
These elections have also proved that India sets consistent standards in choosing their leaders, disproving a biased opinion about democracy and elections that certain western thinking has held towards India. Using a template of a fairness score to evaluate the independence of elections in countries, as a well-known western publication recently did, reduces the process of choices in elections to a rating number which can both end up being biased and patronising, and is dictated by a long-held expectation that Indian polls are simultaneously cantankerous and exotic — a work in progress democracy that promises to be civilised but is never one. It also served to quietly aid a narrative that the democratic processes in the west are superior.
Advertisement Why India’s Free Elections Trumps West’s Bias
Take for instance, the freedom and fairness score accorded to India’s elections, which is 0.53 and compare it to the other nations in their leadup to the elections. Mexico is a country heading for elections this year. In this election cycle, 30 candidates have already been assassinated, according to data from the research firm Laboratorio Electoral. In 2021, 30 candidates were killed while in 2018, the elections saw 24 killings. These elections are expected to be among the most violent. According to western pundits, Mexico has a freedom and fairness score of 0.75 in the conduct of elections, which indicates the elections are more ‘just and fair’ than in India. Parts of western media has been unduly harsh on India, rating its fairness score of elections at 0.53.
Advertisement In Indonesia, the electoral process is still dominated by corrupt or influential leaders who grew powerful during the authoritarian rule of Suharto. Democracy is new, and power oscillated between influential stakeholders, till Joko Widodo, an outsider, broke the stranglehold. Thereafter, a general took over as President — one the west has accused of human rights abuses. Interestingly, Indonesia’s freedom and fairness score stands at 0.68, higher than India. Which means that the credibility of Indian elections is just about better than the banana republics — an assumption that betrays the negative bias of such studies.
The US, rated high in freedom and fairness index by the publication, struggled under serious allegations of tampering and influence by Russia and the subsequent response of Trump supporters laying siege in Washington DC after losing the elections indicated a democracy that was functional but not civilised. On the other hand, far from the history of some of the nations, who have either embraced dysfunctional democracy along the way or seem to be falling by the wayside in terms of their law and order situation in the lead up to the elections, India has maintained an enviable record of holding free and fair elections over seven decades.
Advertisement The Decisive Indian Vote
From the general election held in 1951-52 in which 17.5 crore Indians, voted in the elections to the 18th Lok Sabha that are under way, the process has evolved and matured along with Indian democracy over the decades. So have the voters graduated, from being largely illiterate to being well informed and technically savvy while making choices.
The CEC explained why the voluntary nature of casting votes means that the ECI operates ‘in an entirely persuasive space, inviting the citizens to volunteer to become part of the electoral roll and, thereafter, through systematic voter awareness programmes, motivates them to exercise their franchise.’ There is a high elector to population ratio which underpins the discipline, patience and belief that Indian voters have demonstrated in executing the process. The power of Indian elections demonstrates a growing, emerging India that is willing and ready to show how democracy is a proven political system in this world. Take for instance the example of Jammu and Kashmir.
Advertisement Since 1989, all earlier elections in the region had been plagued by violence and a tendence towards anarchy, influenced by separatist parties. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Anantnag, Srinagar and Baramulla — the Lok Sabha seats — recorded dismal attendance.
Baramulla recorded 46 per cent voting in 1996. Thereafter it has struggled to have voters on election days. Twenty-eight years later, 59 per cent of Baramulla showed up to vote on polling day, breaking the previous record.
This time, local political leaders have addressed large crowds who are keen to be a part of the time-tested process of democracy and express their opinions at the poll booths, unlike earlier times when boycotts dominated Kashmiri elections and the turnout, cowed down by the gun, often struggled to crawl out of single digit percentage attendance.
The resolve to bring Kashmir out of a rut of decades-old militancy by taking the gun out of the equation has helped locals trust the power of the ballot in making lives better instead of being ruled by fear of militancy. There is a growing curiosity about the choices available in a democracy through the power of the ballot, which many people in the state now see value in, unlike across the border where democracy is in shambles and offers no choices.
Younger India: 18 Million First-Time Voters
One of the key aspects in these elections is the addition of over 2-crore young first time voters. These voters, in each successive edition, are going to boost a voting population that consumes digital information and has a strong sense of independent opinion. A keen interest among young voters has led to parties canvassing through digital platforms. An increasingly politically conscious, intelligent but less patient voter base has meant that parties have had to address more matured issues – which also tells us how India has travelled a fair distance from the days when Garibi Hatao was a dominating slogan.
The voter turnout, lower in the early stages, yet reflects an involved participation of its citizens across the country. In a country where different belief systems have held sway, the one common space where India comes together as a country is its general election. Which is why, an election season resembles a festival of choices rather than a mere mechanical process of choosing.
India Votes for the World to Emulate
In the previous national edition in 2019, the Election Commission confirmed a 67 per cent turnout. The Americans were marginally higher in the same period while voting in their elections. The Indian elections have also been among the most expensive elections, in which political parties spent more than 7 billion in 2019, higher than the spends in the US elections in that period. Not only are the Indian general elections the largest poll show on earth — they are also the most intensely contested and certainly, sets the bar for America to follow this November.
While wars and conflicts singe the world in most parts and certain nations have gone berserk losing their way while making choices, India proves yet again that this election festival of citizens is not only the biggest but also the most civilised and sane process on earth.

"Busy dousing fire on Swati Maliwal 'assault' row, AAP loses a week of Kejriwal's freedom and fought against itself than rivals",https://www.firstpost.com/india/busy-dousing-fire-on-swati-maliwal-assault-row-aap-loses-a-week-of-kejriwals-freedom-and-fought-against-itself-than-rivals-13772369.html,"Amid the escalating blame game, the focus abruptly moved from Arvind Kejriwal to Swati Maliwal and the internal feud between Maliwal and other AAP members overshadowed Kejriwal&rsquo;s continuous attacks on the prime minister and the BJP","When the Supreme Court granted interim bail to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on 10 May until 2 June, the AAP leader had a clear agenda ahead. Arrested on 21 March by the Enforcement Directorate in the liquor policy case, Kejriwal now had 21 days to capitalise on his temporary release. His primary focus would have been to generate publicity for himself and the AAP by intensifying his criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP.
Advertisement The Maliwal incident: A shift in focus
This situation progressed smoothly until the Swati Maliwal incident on 13 May. On that day, AAP Rajya Sabha MP Swati Maliwal accused Bibhav Kumar, a member of Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal&rsquo;s personal staff of misconduct. Following her allegations, the Delhi Police arrested Kejriwal&rsquo;s private assistant Bibhav Kumar, igniting a dual conflict: AAP versus BJP and Swati Maliwal versus the rest of AAP.
Amid the escalating blame game, two significant shifts occurred. First, the focus abruptly moved from Arvind Kejriwal to Swati Maliwal. Second, the internal feud between Maliwal and other AAP members overshadowed Kejriwal&rsquo;s continuous attacks on the prime minister and the BJP.
Significantly, this incident consumed a crucial portion of Kejriwal&rsquo;s 21 days of freedom with an entire week diverted to the Maliwal controversy.
Strategic reorientation
Regardless of whether AAP inadvertently fell into a trap or recognised the situation belatedly, Kejriwal understood the pressing need to redirect attention back to himself. He needed to refocus the battle onto BJP territory and distance the party from the Maliwal incident. Whether it was genuine support for his long-time aide Kumar or a strategy to revitalise AAP, the Delhi chief minister knew that a significant move was necessary to reclaim the spotlight.
What better way to do it than challenge Prime Minister Modi to arrest all AAP leaders as he announced on Saturday that he would march to BJP headquarters in Delhi on Sunday at noon accompanied by all the prominent leaders of his party. More the chaos better the publicity.
Advertisement Kejriwal alleged that the BJP was trying to completely destroy AAP through Operation Jhadu. He shared that people who were familiar with both the BJP and him had informed him that Prime Minister Modi acknowledged AAP&rsquo;s growing influence and the global discussion around their work. Kejriwal said that the BJP saw AAP as a potential tough challenger in several states and wanted to eliminate them. He made these statements while addressing the press at the party office on Sunday.
Importance of Delhi for AAP
Voting for all seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi is scheduled for 25 May as part of Phase 6 of the polling.
Advertisement Delhi is of paramount importance to the AAP for several reasons. It is the party&rsquo;s primary base and stronghold where it was founded and first achieved significant political success by winning the Delhi Legislative Assembly elections in 2013. Maintaining control over Delhi is essential for AAP&rsquo;s political legitimacy and influence. Furthermore, Delhi serves as a showcase for AAP&rsquo;s governance model and policies.
AAP finds itself grappling with the challenge of maintaining a focussed engagement with its diverse electorate in Delhi, which encompasses various socioeconomic groups. Amid its efforts to highlight flagship programmes such as mohalla clinics, subsidised electricity and its work in government schools, the controversy surrounding Maliwal has diverted public attention from these areas which AAP would have wanted to bring in front of the voters.
Advertisement Whether the Maliwal incident is indeed a premeditated attack on AAP as the party alleges or simply a coincidence only time will reveal. However, there is no doubt that it has placed AAP in a defensive position precisely when it was gearing up for a strong offensive. Whether it&rsquo;s a calculated move by a political mastermind or just an unfortunate stroke of fate remains uncertain for now.

How Swati Maliwal row is disrupting Arvind Kejriwal’s campaign for Lok Sabha polls,https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/swati-maliwal-row-arvind-kejriwal-13772041.html,"While Arvind Kejriwal&rsquo;s release from jail to campaign for the Lok Sabha polls came as a big relief to the AAP and the Opposition, the Swati Maliwal controversy has cast a pall over proceedings. While the Delhi chief minister has remained mum over the matter, the party has claimed that there is a &lsquo;BJP conspiracy&rsquo; to frame him","Arvind Kejriwal must have felt great relief when he was granted bail by the Supreme Court.
The apex court granted the Delhi chief minister bail in the alleged money laundering case in order to campaign for the Lok Sabha polls.
But the controversy over Swati Maliwal has dogged Kejriwal at every step.
Maliwal, the AAP&rsquo;s Rajya Sabha MP, filed an FIR on Thursday accusing the Delhi chief minister&rsquo;s aide Bibhav Kumar of assaulting her. Advertisement The AAP has alleged a conspiracy is being hatched against Kejriwal, while the BJP has demanded stringent action against the accused.
Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at how the row has disrupted his campaign:
Kejriwal&rsquo;s release from jail was a big boost to the party and the Opposition.
The Times of India quoted Sandeep Pathak, a close aide of Kejriwal who is overseeing the AAP Lok Sabha campaign, as saying the development breathed fresh life into the party.
&ldquo;With him, the cadre feels happier, much more positive, much more charged. That’s one aspect of it. The other is that the BJP thought that they would get Kejriwal arrested and then start breaking up the AAP in Delhi and Punjab. But they miserably failed,&rdquo; the AAP Rajya Sabha MP said.
But Maliwal&rsquo;s accusations have now cast a pall over proceedings.
&ldquo;While the whole truth is not out yet, all is certainly not well inside the AAP. There have been reports of differences between Kejriwal and Maliwal for some time. There are claims that Kejriwal was not happy with Maliwal&rsquo;s absence from Delhi before and after his arrest as well as her relative silence on his arrest. Maliwal, however, was reportedly visiting her sister in the US,&rdquo; the piece stated.
It noted that if Kejriwal is sent to jail again for a long time, the party is likely to fracture. But if he is granted regular bail, he will likely be able to keep his team together.
&ldquo;What was supposed to be a few weeks of respite for Kejriwal are proving to be a testing period. His attention will now be divided between the election campaign and the party affairs,&rdquo; the piece noted.
Advertisement On Wednesday some people also raised slogans during Kejriwal&rsquo;s road show in Chandni Chowk against Kumar, as per The Times of India.
&lsquo;Slapped, hit in stomach&rsquo;
Maliwal in her FIR filed Thursday claimed she was &ldquo;slapped, hit in the stomach and kicked&rdquo; by Kumar.
The FIR was registered after Maliwal&rsquo;s statement was recorded by a two-member team led by Additional Commissioner of Police P.S. Kushwaha.
The team was at Maliwal&rsquo;s residence in central Delhi for nearly four and a half hours.
AAP Rajya Sabha MP Swati Maliwal has accused Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal&rsquo;s aide of assault. PTI File Photo Maliwal claimed she ran out of the CM&rsquo;s residence and called the police immediately after the incident.
Kejriwal was present at his residence when the incident took place, she added.
Advertisement Maliwal broke down several times while giving the statement and sought strict action against Kumar.
The AAP MP on Thursday underwent medical check-up at All India Institute of Medical Sciences.
Kejriwal evades question, BJP attacks
Adding fuel to the fire, Kejriwal on Wednesday did not address Maliwal&rsquo;s allegations during a press conference.
Kejriwal, flanked by Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav and AAP Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh, evaded a question on the subject.
Singh, however, said his party has already made its stand clear on the issue.

He (PM) should answer on the issue of Swati Maliwal, who was dragged and beaten when she went to seek justice for the female wrestlers. I just want to say don&rsquo;t play political games on the issues,&rdquo; he said.
Yadav then took the microphone and said &ldquo;there are more important things than that&rdquo;.
Then, unfolding a piece of paper, he added, &ldquo;BJP people are not with anyone, it is a &lsquo;gang&rsquo; that lodges false cases&rdquo;.
Singh at a press conference on Tuesday had accepted that Kumar had &ldquo;misbehaved&rdquo; with Maliwal.
He also labelled the incident &lsquo;highly condemnable&rsquo;, as per The Times of India.
BJP national spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia claimed that Kejriwal is the main &ldquo;criminal&rdquo; in the complaint that his aide Kumar had physically attacked Maliwal at the chief minister&rsquo;s residence, as he cited the telephone call she had made to the Delhi Police to report the matter.
&ldquo;His (Kejriwal) silence speaks a lot. Out of jail, he is more a &lsquo;goonda&rsquo; than a chief minister,&rdquo; he told reporters, noting that Kumar was seen with the chief minister in Lucknow.
Stringent action should be taken against the accused in the case, he said.
Kumar, he noted, was photographed with Kejriwal during his visit to Lucknow.
On Friday, the Delhi BJP Mahila Morcha members staged a protest near Kejriwal&rsquo;s residence.
Led by Mahila Morcha president Richa Pandey Mishra, the protesters, who were carrying bangles, demanded Kejriwal&rsquo;s resignation.
Mishra said the Mahila Morcha wanted to hand over the bangles to Kejriwal for keeping mum over the incident with Maliwal that occurred at his official residence.
“Arvind Kejriwal should be ashamed. He should resign from his post and apologise to the country. Swati Maliwal should get justice,&quot; a Mahila Morcha member told PTI.
The Mahila Morcha of the Delhi BJP also extended support to Maliwal, writing a letter to her saying the incident was a matter of honour of women in the country.
A team of the Delhi Police also turned up at Kejriwal&rsquo;s residence on Friday, as per India Today.
&lsquo;BJP conspiracy to frame Kejirwal&rsquo;
Meanwhile, the AAP has claimed the case is a &lsquo;BJP conspiracy to frame Kejriwal.&rsquo;
Senior AAP leader Atishi at a press conference said, &ldquo;Today a video has surfaced that has exposed the lie of Maliwal. In her FIR, she has said she was brutally assaulted and she was in pain, and buttons of her shirt were torn. A video that has surfaced shows an entirely different reality.&rdquo;
Atishi said the video shows Maliwal &ldquo;comfortably sitting in the drawing room&rdquo; and &ldquo;threatening the security staff&rdquo;, and that &ldquo;her clothes were not torn&rdquo;.
&ldquo;The video shows her threatening Kumar. The charges levelled by Maliwal are baseless. Maliwal insisted on meeting Kejriwal. She is Rajya Sabha MP and she should know that the CM has a busy schedule. Kumar told her that the chief minister is busy and unable to meet her. She shouted at him, pushed him and tried to enter the residential portion of the CM House,&rdquo; she claimed.
&ldquo;The whole incident proves that it was a BJP conspiracy and Swati Maliwal was made its face to frame Kejriwal,&rdquo; she alleged.
Asked about Singh accepting misbehaviour with Maliwal, Atishi said, &ldquo;AAP MP Sanjay Singh met Maliwal and he had only her version. But now this video has brought out the truth.&rdquo;

Here&rsquo;s what the News18 exit poll has predicted for the NDA and the INDI Alliance in some of the big states,"The voting for the Lok Sabha elections has come to an end and it’s been a lengthy process — seven long phases spread over six weeks. Now, it’s time to shift attention to the results. Before the results are announced on 4 June, here’s what the exit polls reveal.
Most exit polls are predicting a return of the Narendra Modi-led NDA government, winning over 350 seats, with the Opposition’s INDI Alliance managing somewhere between 125 and 150. News18 conducted its own mega exit poll, according to which NDA has bagged 355-370 seats, while the INDI Alliance has won 125-140 seats.
Advertisement But how has the NDA fared against the INDI Alliance in each state? We break through the clutter and present the results of the News18 mega exit poll in quick, easy graphics.
NORTH
The NDA, as per News18&rsquo;s exit poll, will continue its dominance in the north. In Uttar Pradesh, the NDA is poised to win 68-71 of the 80 seats, while the INDI Alliance is predicted to win nine-12 seats.
In Bihar, the NDA, of which Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s JDU is a part, will be bagging 31-34 seats, while INDI Alliance is believed to get six-nine seats. Delhi and Haryana is all about the NDA once again.
SOUTH
In the South, it seems a Narendra Modi-led push has helped the BJP. Exit polls predict an improved performance of the BJP in the five southern states. It seems in Andhra Pradesh, the alliance with Chandrababu Naidu-led Telugu Desam Party has paid big dividends for the BJP, with the NDA emerging on top. In Telangana, the News18 exit poll gives BJP a big reason to smile, predicting the party to win seven-10 seats, compared to Congress’ five-eight.
Karnataka is also expected to vote overwhelmingly for the BJP, despite its preference for the Congress at the state level. In Tamil Nadu, the party is even expected to make a debut, securing between one-three seats, exit polls predict.

EAST
The News18 exit poll predicts that the BJP-led NDA will build on its 2019 performance in the east. In West Bengal, the BJP seems to be the biggest winner, with the Mamata Banerjee led TMC trailing behind. And in Assam, it&rsquo;s NDA all the way, predicted to win 10-13 seats.
Another big surprise is from the state of Odisha. The exit poll has predicted a clean sweep for the BJP. The poll predicts the BJP will win 13-15 seats, with the BJD to come in second with six-eight seats.
Advertisement WEST
In the West, the BJP-led NDA is predicted to be the big winner as per the exit poll. Gujarat is the big news here with the NDA set to be sweeping all 26 seats. Meanwhile, in Maharashtra, the NDA is predicted to win 32-35 seats, with the INDI Alliance winning 15-18 seats.
In Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, it&rsquo;s all about the NDA once again. The News18 exit poll predicts 26-29 seats for the NDA out of the 29 seats. In Rajasthan, the NDA is predicted to win 18-25 seats.

But how did they fare in 2014 and 2019? Which pollster got it right and which missed the mark?","Voting for the seventh and final phase of the Lok Sabha polls concluded today.
Now, with the counting of votes scheduled for 4 June, all eyes are on the exit polls. The exit polls have been released at 6.30 pm.
This is in line with the Section 126A of the Representation of the People’s Act, 1951, which states that exit polls can only be aired half an hour after the completion of the final phase of voting.
Advertisement But what did they predict in 2014 and 2019? And how accurate are exit polls really?
Let’s take a closer look:
2014
Going into 2014, pollsters were under some pressure.
After all, the exit polls had failed to get it right in back-to-back Lok Sabha elections.
In 2004, the polls predicated that the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA, which was relying on the ‘India shining’ campaign, would win big.
However, the Congress made a huge comeback in 2004.
In 2009, the exit polls predicted the UPA would get the most seats, but that the result would be a hung Parliament.
The Congress-led coalition defied the odds yet again with the Grand Old Party itself getting 200 seats.
In 2014, all the exit polls favoured the BJP-led NDA under Narendra Modi.
For NDA
The News24-Chanakya poll predicted that the NDA would nab 340 seats, while the India Today-Cicero poll gave the coalition 272 seats. The CNN-IBN-CSDS said the alliance would win 280 seats, while the Times Now poll gave the NDA.
The ABP News-Nielsen predicted 274 seats for the NDA, while the NDTV-Hansa Research estimated 279 seats for the NDA.
For UPA
For the UPA, the India Today-Cicero pollster predicted 115 seats, while News 24-Chanakya estimated 101 seats. The CNN-IBN-CSDS gave the alliance 97 seats, while Times Now projected 148 seats.
Advertisement The ABP News-Nielsen said the UPA would win 97 seats, while NDTV-Hansa Research said the alliance would net 103 seats.
Pollsters seemed to underestimate the hunger for change in the public mind as well as the sheer scale of the NDA’s victory and the UPA’s defeat.
Of all the pollsters, the News24-Chanakya was most on the money.
Advertisement The NDA would go on to win a massive 336 seats with the BJP itself crossing the half-way mark in Parliament and netting 282 seats.
The UPA, on the other hand, would be reduced to just 60 seats with the Congress winning 44 seats by its lonesome.
2019 polls
In 2019, most pollsters predicted that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA government would return – albeit with a reduced margin.
For NDA
The India Today-Axis pollster predicted that the NDA would win between 339 and 365 seats, while the News 24-Today’s Chanakya gave the alliance 350 seats.
The News18-IPSOS poll said the NDA would net 336 seats, while Times Now-VMR predicted 306 seats for the NDA.
The India TV-CNX pollster estimated 300 seats for the alliance, while the Sudarshan News poll gave the NDA 305 seats.
Advertisement For UPA
Meanwhile, for the UPA, the India Today-Axi poll predicted between 77 and 108 seats, while the News 24-Today’s Chanakya estimated 95 seats.
The News18-IPSOS poll said the UPA would win 82 seats, while the Times Now-VMR poll gave the alliance 132 seats.
The India TV-CNX predicted 120 seats for the UPA, while Sudarshan News estimated the alliance would net 124 seats.
The India Today-Axis gave the UPA between 77 and 108 seats, while News 24-Today’s Chanakya predicted 95 seats.
Most of the pollsters yet again failed to gauge the popularity of the BJP-led NDA.
Advertisement The NDA, incredibly, ended up bettering its 2014 tally in a resounding vote of confidence in Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The alliance won 352 seats with the BJP itself winning 303 seats.
Meanwhile, the Congress-led UPA expanded its tally to 91 seats with the grand old party winning 52 seats – but it was nothing to write home about.
The News 24-Today’s Chanakya was yet again the most accurate pollster.
Are exit polls accurate?
Not necessarily.
As noted above, pollsters have been off the mark with remarkable frequency in at least four recent Lok Sabha elections including 2004 and 2009.
Exit polls are also often condemned for being biased, relying on skewed data or improper sample size, and being sponsored or politically motivated, Business Standard.
The Economic Times quoted TK Arun as saying, “Exit polls are tricky in India. Indians are prudent people. Why would they tell a pollster anything other than what they figure out the pollster wants to hear? Suppose he voted Congress, and says so to the pollster, the BJP wins the election and extracts from pollsters details of all those who said they voted Congress, what mayhem might not follow? Why take the risk? Indians can be rational when the issue at stake is lack of faith as well.”
In short, exit polls can be hazardous to a political junkie’s health.

Lok Sabha Election 2024: How are exit polls conducted and are they accurate?,https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-are-exit-polls-conducted-how-accurate-are-exit-polls-lok-sabha-elections-2024-exit-polls-general-elections-13777162.html,"The largest democratic exercise in the world, India&rsquo;s 18th Lok Sabha Elections, concludes today. Following the 44-day electoral process, exit polls will commence, providing predictions on the likely victors and the extent of their triumph. What are these polls? Do they always get it right?","India&rsquo;s 18th Lok Sabha Elections, the largest democratic exercise on the planet, will conclude on 1 June, 2024 as the seventh phase comes to a close . As the lengthy 44-day electoral process ends, attention will shift to exit polls, which are expected to provide insights into the election outcomes starting from 6:30 pm on 1 June.
Exit polls are crucial for gauging the mood of the electorate and predicting the likely winners before the official results are declared. However, their accuracy and methodology are often subjects of debate and scrutiny.
Advertisement What is the methodology behind exit polls?
Exit polls are conducted by surveying voters immediately after they cast their votes. This method contrasts with opinion polls, which are conducted before the elections to gather voters&rsquo; views on various issues and candidates. Exit polls aim to provide a snapshot of voting trends, influenced by various factors such as issues, personalities, and party loyalties.
The methodology of exit polls involves interviewing voters outside polling stations using a structured questionnaire. This approach relies on the voters&rsquo; recent experiences, increasing the likelihood of obtaining accurate responses.

AP The data collected is then analysed to estimate vote shares and predict seat outcomes. These polls are typically conducted by private firms or media organisations rather than government agencies.
How has technology changed conducting exit polls?
Technological advancements have significantly influenced the conduct of exit polls. Techniques such as call-backs to respondents, images of interviews being conducted, phone calls from the field, and WhatsApp groups have enhanced data collection and analysis.
Despite these advancements, ensuring the accuracy of predictions remains challenging due to the complex and diverse nature of the Indian electorate.

AP Structured questionnaires are vital for coherent data collection and systematic analysis, reported Indian Express. The Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) emphasises the importance of representative samples in ensuring accurate predictions. A large sample size is crucial, but the representativeness of the sample is equally important.
Advertisement What challenges are faced while conducting exit polls?
Estimating vote shares and predicting seat outcomes are the primary challenges in conducting exit polls. The swing model, which relies on past election results, is influenced by various factors such as geographic location, caste, religion, and economic class.
Changes in political alliances between elections can also affect predictions. The prediction process is labour-intensive and time-consuming, as it involves making estimates for each seat.

AP The complexity of swings increases with the number of political players. For example, the BJP and JD(U) alliance in Bihar poses a challenge for the swing model. Over- or under-representation of diverse voter sections can impact the accuracy of estimates.
Advertisement How accurate are exit polls?
The accuracy of exit polls depends on various factors beyond sample size. The representativeness of the sample, the methodology used, and the ability to account for diverse voter profiles are critical. Some agencies rely on innovative methods, such as eliminating certain constituencies from the poll, to improve accuracy.
Also Read: Predictions, predilections, and Indian general elections For instance, the Lokniti-CSDS uses post-poll surveys with large sample sizes but echoes the need for representative samples. Their predictions have varied in accuracy, highlighting the complexities involved in electoral predictions.
Have exit polls ever got it wrong?
Historically, exit polls have had mixed accuracy. Some notable instances where exit polls diverged significantly from actual results include:
Advertisement 2004 Lok Sabha Elections: Exit polls predicted a majority for the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA government. However, the actual results saw the NDA falling short of expectations.
Delhi Assembly Elections 2015: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) secured a sweeping victory with 67 out of 70 seats, which was underestimated by exit polls.
Bihar Assembly Elections 2015: Exit polls predicted a close race, but the RJD-JDU-Congress coalition won decisively.
UP Assembly Elections 2017: Despite exit polls predicting a hung assembly, the BJP won over 300 seats.
2014 Lok Sabha Elections: Exit polls did not foresee the BJP achieving an outright majority, which it did by crossing the 272-mark on its own.
In India, exit polls are regulated under Section 126A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. This section prohibits the conduct and publication of exit polls during the polling period to avoid influencing voters.

Why are exit polls released after all votes are cast? Why are they relevant?,https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-are-exit-polls-released-after-all-votes-are-cast-why-are-they-relevant-13776094.html,Exit polls are essentially quick interviews with voters.

The seventh and final phase of the Lok Sabha polls is underway with 57 parliamentary constituencies set to cast their vote across eight states and union territories.

But what do we know about exit polls? What is their history? Why are they relevant? And what about their rules?

What are they?
Exit polls are essentially quick interviews with voters.
They are usually conducted right after voters exit the polls on voting day – as opposed to opinion polls which are conducted beforehand.
The idea behind them is to offer a snapshot of the voters’ concerns. They are aimed at predicting which party is likely to come to power.
Several news channels and agencies in India conduct exit polls – with varying degrees of success.
As per Business Standard, their accuracy depends on a slew of factors including structured questionnaires, in-person or telephonic interviews of random people for fairness, sample size, demographic representation, data compilation, and count method.
The first exit poll was conducted in 1957 by the Indian Institute of Public Opinion.
The group conducted an exit poll during the second Lok Sabha elections.
As per Hindustan Times, it was the Delhi-based Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) that pioneered in the 1960s.
But it was another two decades before exit polls began being taken seriously in the media.
This is when psephologist Prannoy Roy teamed up with David Butler.
Advertisement Roy, Butler and Ashok Lahiri would go on to publish a landmark book The Compendium of Indian Elections.
State-run Doordarshan asking the CSDS to conduct a countrywide exit poll in 1996 also brought exit polls further into the mainstream.
“Without a structured questionnaire, the data can neither be collected coherently nor be analysed systematically to arrive at vote share estimates,” Indian Express quoted Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) director Sanjay Kumar as saying.
What are the rules for exit polls?
Exit polls are governed by The Representation of People Act, 1951.
Section 126 A of the act restricts publication and dissemination of exit polls results.
Advertisement Exit polls are usually conducted right after voters exit the polls on voting day – as opposed to opinion polls which are conducted beforehand. PTI It states, “No person shall conduct any exit poll and publish or publicise by means of the print or electronic media or disseminate in any other manner, whatsoever, the result of any exit poll during such period, as may be notified by the Election Commission in this regard.”
It adds that in case of a general election, the period may commence from the beginning of the hours fixed for the poll on the first day and continue till half an hour after the closing of the poll in all the States and Union territories.
According to Business Standard, this is done so that exit polls don’t influence voters or voting patterns.
Advertisement Those who violate this provision can be sentenced to a prison term of up to two years, a fine or both.
The Election Commission first issued guidelines on exit polls in 1998. The EC under Article 324 of the Constitution barred newspapers and television news channels from publishing or broadcasting results of opinion and exit polls between 5 pm on 14 February 1998 and 5 pm on 7 March 1998. The first phase in that year’s general elections began on 16 February 1998, and the final phase began on 7 March.
As per Economic Times, the EC in 2022 said news broadcasters must not air any final, formal and definite results &ldquo;until such results are formally announced by the Election Commission of India, unless such results are carried with clear disclaimer that they are unofficial or incomplete or partial results or projections which should not be taken as final results.&rdquo;
Advertisement Why are exit polls relevant?
Because people want to know which party and candidates are likely to win &ndash; and quickly.
However, critics say that they are often left wanting when it comes to accuracy.
According to Business Standard, exit polls are also often condemned for being biased, relying on skewed data or improper sample size, and being sponsored or politically motivated. The Economic Times quoted TK Arun as saying, &ldquo;Exit polls are tricky in India. Indians are prudent people. Why would they tell a pollster anything other than what they figure out the pollster wants to hear? Suppose he voted Congress, and says so to the pollster, the BJP wins the election and extracts from pollsters details of all those who said they voted Congress, what mayhem might not follow? Why take the risk? Indians can be rational when the issue at stake is lack of faith as well.&rdquo;
In the past, exit polls have had both hits and misses galore.
According to Hindustan Times, except for the 1998 and 2014 polls, at least four Lok Sabha polls have gotten it badly wrong.
This includes two back-to-back predictions in 2004 and 2009.
The 2004 exit polls in particular were a massive failure with the pollsters completely missing the Congress coming back to power as the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA with its ‘India Shining’ slogan lost its majority.
All exit polls predicted a win for the BJP.
Again in 2009, while most pollsters gave the edge to the UPA, they completely missed a huge swing in its favour.
The UPA added 40 more seats to its tally.
A man looks at a television screen showing exit poll results after the last phase of the general election in Ahmedabad on 19 May 2019. File photo/Reuters In 2014, the BJP won over 330 seats.
While most pollsters said then prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi and the BJP-led NDA would cross the 272 mark, almost none of them forecast the decisive performance.
It was only pollster Chanakya, who predicted 340 seats for the NDA, that came close to getting it spot on.
In 2019, most pollsters predicted that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA government would return &ndash; albeit with a reduced margin compared to the previous election. Of course, we know that the pollsters yet again underestimated the strength of the BJP-led NDA, which would nab 353 seats.

Be it the stock market, astrology, or gambling, our insatiable curiosity for the mysterious and unknown is probably what propels such abandonment.
Take the ongoing Lok Sabha polls, going on for perhaps too long now, and the concomitant barrage of prophecies from TV channels, from YouTube “influenczars” and from downright bored individuals, all of whom shoot off their incendiary numbers into the tinder of social media. These soothsayers speak from relative ignorance and mostly from a fascination for a particular party, be they pidis or bhakts.They speak with the confidence that they can actually fool all the people all the time, with Abraham Lincoln being the ultimate fool, poor man. What is most horrendous is that all of them have declared random numbers like 180, 200, 250, 272, 303, 320, 362, 370, and the ace of spades, 400, long before all the votes have come in. This is why I liken election predictions in India to gambling. It is matka guessing in a satta bazar. Parrot talk, or tarot talk, it leads to no concrete outcome. It does not affect the choices made by the voters, choices one suspects were cast in stone, long before the elections were even announced. And yet, these delirious djinns persist, as their minds are made up too. The happy side to this sad fantasy is that it is time-bound, and we can all reclaim our normal lives on June 4.
Advertisement Lighter comments aside, there is a more serious side to prediction, based on the assumption that future events are influenced to some or a greater extent by what has happened before. History is our greatest teacher. The art and science of good prediction lie in identifying which past (or present) event will likely influence an event to come. Let us take the Indian monsoon, an annual event of major economic importance to our nation, and one that has just begun this year. It would help the government enormously if it knew a few months in advance if the monsoon were to be normal, below average, or will punch above its weight.
At present, the Indian monsoon is predicted using a combination of atmospheric models, sea surface temperature analysis, historical data, and satellite observations. Key factors include the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, the Indian Ocean Dipole, and wind patterns. Advanced computational models simulate these variables to forecast rainfall and monsoon onset accurately. However, there are totally different methods of monsoon prediction that would not be considered ‘scientific’ by western definition, but are yet chillingly accurate. Traditionally, some Indian communities predict the monsoon by observing the nesting behaviour of certain birds, like the Indian weaver bird (Baya Weaver). It is believed that if these birds build their nests on higher branches, a heavier monsoon will ensue. Conversely, lower nests indicate lighter rainfall. This method relies on the birds&rsquo; instinctive response to environmental cues, and seems to be largely reliable. Nature lovers might like to correlate this occurrence with the Japanese kō or 72 micro-seasons, for further poetic justification.
Advertisement Prediction is a key aspect of science, and the smaller the number of known events, phenomena, and parameters used to predict a large number of future events accurately, the better the value of the prediction. At the risk of introducing an equation in this column, one can say the value of a prediction, V = (N/n) – 1, where one is able to correctly predict N outcomes with n parameters. According to this equation, the value of a prediction is zero if one needs n parameters to predict N outcomes.
Let’s apply this equation to the present Lok Sabha election. We could say that N = 543, in other words, we want to correctly predict the results from 543 constituencies. How many parameters would we need, or what is the value of n, for a good prediction? What our present-day pollsters are doing, in trying to improve the accuracy of their guesses, is to increase the number of parameters to absurd levels. They ask whether all the Muslim women in Kishanganj will vote like their menfolk, whether the hot summer days in Ramagundam will harm voting, or whether all the Gounders in Kovai will stay loyal to the AIADMK. The problem with such micro-parameters is that they cannot be quantified properly. Informal surveys on the ground may not be the answer because all respondents may not answer truthfully. We see ludicrous statements from politicians—some say that low turnouts hurt the BJP, while others say that low turnouts hurt the Congress. Others say that a low or high turnout may help or hurt a party, depending on the state. Still others say that whatever happens, Congress is winning. The problem with any or all of this is that none of it can be either proven or disproven—this makes it non-scientific. The reader will appreciate that as n increases with all these unprovable parameters, the value of the prediction quickly goes to zero. It is easier to say that there is only one parameter in this election, and that is the prime minister himself. Applying the equation, the value of my prediction is (543/1) – 1 = 542, which in practical terms means a sizable majority for the BJP. I think I’m doing pretty well for myself with this prediction. June 4 will tell.
Advertisement What I would have liked to see, and what seems missing, is a more accurate assessment of ‘swing’ constituencies in bellwether states. No expert needs to predict that the BJP will win in Gandhinagar or that it will lose in South Kolkata. On the other hand, if the BJP were to win in Thiruvananthapuram, Bengaluru Rural, Hyderabad, or Central Chennai, this would signify that winds of change are blowing across the country. The very high voter turnout in Baramulla is another pointer. An ability to extrapolate from this to an accurate prediction about the Kashmir Valley in particular and the country in general, is what is missing. Once again, what I would like to see on June 4 is how soon any particular TV channel is able to call the election, say by 9, 10, or 11 am? The sooner it is able to do this, the better its reports will be and the less fluff and bluff.
Advertisement Election predictions are notoriously hard due to the changing nature of the parameters, something we do not usually see in science. The Truman-Dewey US presidential election of 1945, was made memorable by the photograph of the victor, Harry Truman, brandishing a copy of the Chicago Tribune that screamed the wrong headline, “Dewey defeats Truman”. So close was the vote. At the end of World War II, the UK voted against Winston Churchill, their doughty PM, who had saved them from Nazi tyranny. He was hustled out of office when the Labour Party won by a substantial majority. Can we ever imagine a similar situation in India? And yet, some of our own elections have indeed yielded surprising results, and one recollects 1971, 1977, and 2019, when the decisiveness of the mandate was quite something else.

Beyond the Lines | Indian elections: What the biggest show on earth can teach the world,https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/beyond-the-lines-indian-elections-what-the-biggest-show-on-earth-can-teach-the-world-13773225.html,"Not only are the Indian general elections the largest poll show on earth — they are also the most intensely contested and certainly, sets the bar for America to follow this November","This was going to be the global election year that decides the fate of the world. This was also going to be the biggest election in the world’s biggest democracy. With over 900 million broadband subscribers, the Indian voter is more plugged into the commentary of the voting analysis, trends and outcomes.
The cacophony of election analysis is hardwired into the heads of Indian citizens through their phones and devices, their choices dictated by opinions and beliefs, which in turn has been an outcome of results seen in the last five years. Yet, when I went to cast my vote this Monday, the booth-level machinery was so well-oiled and efficient that beyond the cacophony of election sloganeering and digital pyrotechnics, the unassuming power of silent citizens dutifully stepping up to vote on their appointed day, sans drama or hyperbole, held up a useful guide for the rest of the world to emulate.
Advertisement India, the world’s most populous democracy, is currently holding its general election over a seven-phase period that continues for seven weeks. Indians can vote between 19 April and 1 June, with the results set to be declared on 4 June.
The World Decides in 2024
Over fifty elections take place in 2024, including some of the most impacting ones such as the US, Russia, India, Taiwan. Fifty-one per cent of the world will either have a new dispensation or continue with the existing one. As elections take place across the world, the festival of democracy in India is expected to be among the keenly contested, fair and well organised ones in the world.
These elections have also proved that India sets consistent standards in choosing their leaders, disproving a biased opinion about democracy and elections that certain western thinking has held towards India. Using a template of a fairness score to evaluate the independence of elections in countries, as a well-known western publication recently did, reduces the process of choices in elections to a rating number which can both end up being biased and patronising, and is dictated by a long-held expectation that Indian polls are simultaneously cantankerous and exotic — a work in progress democracy that promises to be civilised but is never one. It also served to quietly aid a narrative that the democratic processes in the west are superior.
Advertisement Why India’s Free Elections Trumps West’s Bias
Take for instance, the freedom and fairness score accorded to India’s elections, which is 0.53 and compare it to the other nations in their leadup to the elections. Mexico is a country heading for elections this year. In this election cycle, 30 candidates have already been assassinated, according to data from the research firm Laboratorio Electoral. In 2021, 30 candidates were killed while in 2018, the elections saw 24 killings. These elections are expected to be among the most violent. According to western pundits, Mexico has a freedom and fairness score of 0.75 in the conduct of elections, which indicates the elections are more ‘just and fair’ than in India. Parts of western media has been unduly harsh on India, rating its fairness score of elections at 0.53.
Advertisement In Indonesia, the electoral process is still dominated by corrupt or influential leaders who grew powerful during the authoritarian rule of Suharto. Democracy is new, and power oscillated between influential stakeholders, till Joko Widodo, an outsider, broke the stranglehold. Thereafter, a general took over as President — one the west has accused of human rights abuses. Interestingly, Indonesia’s freedom and fairness score stands at 0.68, higher than India. Which means that the credibility of Indian elections is just about better than the banana republics — an assumption that betrays the negative bias of such studies.
The US, rated high in freedom and fairness index by the publication, struggled under serious allegations of tampering and influence by Russia and the subsequent response of Trump supporters laying siege in Washington DC after losing the elections indicated a democracy that was functional but not civilised. On the other hand, far from the history of some of the nations, who have either embraced dysfunctional democracy along the way or seem to be falling by the wayside in terms of their law and order situation in the lead up to the elections, India has maintained an enviable record of holding free and fair elections over seven decades.
Advertisement The Decisive Indian Vote
From the general election held in 1951-52 in which 17.5 crore Indians, voted in the elections to the 18th Lok Sabha that are under way, the process has evolved and matured along with Indian democracy over the decades. So have the voters graduated, from being largely illiterate to being well informed and technically savvy while making choices.
The CEC explained why the voluntary nature of casting votes means that the ECI operates ‘in an entirely persuasive space, inviting the citizens to volunteer to become part of the electoral roll and, thereafter, through systematic voter awareness programmes, motivates them to exercise their franchise.’ There is a high elector to population ratio which underpins the discipline, patience and belief that Indian voters have demonstrated in executing the process. The power of Indian elections demonstrates a growing, emerging India that is willing and ready to show how democracy is a proven political system in this world. Take for instance the example of Jammu and Kashmir.
Advertisement Since 1989, all earlier elections in the region had been plagued by violence and a tendence towards anarchy, influenced by separatist parties. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Anantnag, Srinagar and Baramulla — the Lok Sabha seats — recorded dismal attendance.
Baramulla recorded 46 per cent voting in 1996. Thereafter it has struggled to have voters on election days. Twenty-eight years later, 59 per cent of Baramulla showed up to vote on polling day, breaking the previous record.
This time, local political leaders have addressed large crowds who are keen to be a part of the time-tested process of democracy and express their opinions at the poll booths, unlike earlier times when boycotts dominated Kashmiri elections and the turnout, cowed down by the gun, often struggled to crawl out of single digit percentage attendance.
The resolve to bring Kashmir out of a rut of decades-old militancy by taking the gun out of the equation has helped locals trust the power of the ballot in making lives better instead of being ruled by fear of militancy. There is a growing curiosity about the choices available in a democracy through the power of the ballot, which many people in the state now see value in, unlike across the border where democracy is in shambles and offers no choices.
Younger India: 18 Million First-Time Voters
One of the key aspects in these elections is the addition of over 2-crore young first time voters. These voters, in each successive edition, are going to boost a voting population that consumes digital information and has a strong sense of independent opinion. A keen interest among young voters has led to parties canvassing through digital platforms. An increasingly politically conscious, intelligent but less patient voter base has meant that parties have had to address more matured issues – which also tells us how India has travelled a fair distance from the days when Garibi Hatao was a dominating slogan.
The voter turnout, lower in the early stages, yet reflects an involved participation of its citizens across the country. In a country where different belief systems have held sway, the one common space where India comes together as a country is its general election. Which is why, an election season resembles a festival of choices rather than a mere mechanical process of choosing.
India Votes for the World to Emulate
In the previous national edition in 2019, the Election Commission confirmed a 67 per cent turnout. The Americans were marginally higher in the same period while voting in their elections. The Indian elections have also been among the most expensive elections, in which political parties spent more than 7 billion in 2019, higher than the spends in the US elections in that period. Not only are the Indian general elections the largest poll show on earth — they are also the most intensely contested and certainly, sets the bar for America to follow this November.
While wars and conflicts singe the world in most parts and certain nations have gone berserk losing their way while making choices, India proves yet again that this election festival of citizens is not only the biggest but also the most civilised and sane process on earth.

"Busy dousing fire on Swati Maliwal 'assault' row, AAP loses a week of Kejriwal's freedom and fought against itself than rivals",https://www.firstpost.com/india/busy-dousing-fire-on-swati-maliwal-assault-row-aap-loses-a-week-of-kejriwals-freedom-and-fought-against-itself-than-rivals-13772369.html,"Amid the escalating blame game, the focus abruptly moved from Arvind Kejriwal to Swati Maliwal and the internal feud between Maliwal and other AAP members overshadowed Kejriwal&rsquo;s continuous attacks on the prime minister and the BJP","When the Supreme Court granted interim bail to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on 10 May until 2 June, the AAP leader had a clear agenda ahead. Arrested on 21 March by the Enforcement Directorate in the liquor policy case, Kejriwal now had 21 days to capitalise on his temporary release. His primary focus would have been to generate publicity for himself and the AAP by intensifying his criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP.
Advertisement The Maliwal incident: A shift in focus
This situation progressed smoothly until the Swati Maliwal incident on 13 May. On that day, AAP Rajya Sabha MP Swati Maliwal accused Bibhav Kumar, a member of Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal&rsquo;s personal staff of misconduct. Following her allegations, the Delhi Police arrested Kejriwal&rsquo;s private assistant Bibhav Kumar, igniting a dual conflict: AAP versus BJP and Swati Maliwal versus the rest of AAP.
Amid the escalating blame game, two significant shifts occurred. First, the focus abruptly moved from Arvind Kejriwal to Swati Maliwal. Second, the internal feud between Maliwal and other AAP members overshadowed Kejriwal&rsquo;s continuous attacks on the prime minister and the BJP.
Significantly, this incident consumed a crucial portion of Kejriwal&rsquo;s 21 days of freedom with an entire week diverted to the Maliwal controversy.
Strategic reorientation
Regardless of whether AAP inadvertently fell into a trap or recognised the situation belatedly, Kejriwal understood the pressing need to redirect attention back to himself. He needed to refocus the battle onto BJP territory and distance the party from the Maliwal incident. Whether it was genuine support for his long-time aide Kumar or a strategy to revitalise AAP, the Delhi chief minister knew that a significant move was necessary to reclaim the spotlight.
What better way to do it than challenge Prime Minister Modi to arrest all AAP leaders as he announced on Saturday that he would march to BJP headquarters in Delhi on Sunday at noon accompanied by all the prominent leaders of his party. More the chaos better the publicity.
Advertisement Kejriwal alleged that the BJP was trying to completely destroy AAP through Operation Jhadu. He shared that people who were familiar with both the BJP and him had informed him that Prime Minister Modi acknowledged AAP&rsquo;s growing influence and the global discussion around their work. Kejriwal said that the BJP saw AAP as a potential tough challenger in several states and wanted to eliminate them. He made these statements while addressing the press at the party office on Sunday.
Importance of Delhi for AAP
Voting for all seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi is scheduled for 25 May as part of Phase 6 of the polling.
Advertisement Delhi is of paramount importance to the AAP for several reasons. It is the party&rsquo;s primary base and stronghold where it was founded and first achieved significant political success by winning the Delhi Legislative Assembly elections in 2013. Maintaining control over Delhi is essential for AAP&rsquo;s political legitimacy and influence. Furthermore, Delhi serves as a showcase for AAP&rsquo;s governance model and policies.
AAP finds itself grappling with the challenge of maintaining a focussed engagement with its diverse electorate in Delhi, which encompasses various socioeconomic groups. Amid its efforts to highlight flagship programmes such as mohalla clinics, subsidised electricity and its work in government schools, the controversy surrounding Maliwal has diverted public attention from these areas which AAP would have wanted to bring in front of the voters.
Advertisement Whether the Maliwal incident is indeed a premeditated attack on AAP as the party alleges or simply a coincidence only time will reveal. However, there is no doubt that it has placed AAP in a defensive position precisely when it was gearing up for a strong offensive. Whether it&rsquo;s a calculated move by a political mastermind or just an unfortunate stroke of fate remains uncertain for now.

How Swati Maliwal row is disrupting Arvind Kejriwal’s campaign for Lok Sabha polls,https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/swati-maliwal-row-arvind-kejriwal-13772041.html,"While Arvind Kejriwal&rsquo;s release from jail to campaign for the Lok Sabha polls came as a big relief to the AAP and the Opposition, the Swati Maliwal controversy has cast a pall over proceedings. While the Delhi chief minister has remained mum over the matter, the party has claimed that there is a &lsquo;BJP conspiracy&rsquo; to frame him","Arvind Kejriwal must have felt great relief when he was granted bail by the Supreme Court.
The apex court granted the Delhi chief minister bail in the alleged money laundering case in order to campaign for the Lok Sabha polls.
But the controversy over Swati Maliwal has dogged Kejriwal at every step.
Maliwal, the AAP&rsquo;s Rajya Sabha MP, filed an FIR on Thursday accusing the Delhi chief minister&rsquo;s aide Bibhav Kumar of assaulting her. Advertisement The AAP has alleged a conspiracy is being hatched against Kejriwal, while the BJP has demanded stringent action against the accused.
Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at how the row has disrupted his campaign:
Kejriwal&rsquo;s release from jail was a big boost to the party and the Opposition.
The Times of India quoted Sandeep Pathak, a close aide of Kejriwal who is overseeing the AAP Lok Sabha campaign, as saying the development breathed fresh life into the party.
&ldquo;With him, the cadre feels happier, much more positive, much more charged. That’s one aspect of it. The other is that the BJP thought that they would get Kejriwal arrested and then start breaking up the AAP in Delhi and Punjab. But they miserably failed,&rdquo; the AAP Rajya Sabha MP said.
But Maliwal&rsquo;s accusations have now cast a pall over proceedings.
&ldquo;While the whole truth is not out yet, all is certainly not well inside the AAP. There have been reports of differences between Kejriwal and Maliwal for some time. There are claims that Kejriwal was not happy with Maliwal&rsquo;s absence from Delhi before and after his arrest as well as her relative silence on his arrest. Maliwal, however, was reportedly visiting her sister in the US,&rdquo; the piece stated.
It noted that if Kejriwal is sent to jail again for a long time, the party is likely to fracture. But if he is granted regular bail, he will likely be able to keep his team together.
&ldquo;What was supposed to be a few weeks of respite for Kejriwal are proving to be a testing period. His attention will now be divided between the election campaign and the party affairs,&rdquo; the piece noted.
Advertisement On Wednesday some people also raised slogans during Kejriwal&rsquo;s road show in Chandni Chowk against Kumar, as per The Times of India.
&lsquo;Slapped, hit in stomach&rsquo;
Maliwal in her FIR filed Thursday claimed she was &ldquo;slapped, hit in the stomach and kicked&rdquo; by Kumar.
The FIR was registered after Maliwal&rsquo;s statement was recorded by a two-member team led by Additional Commissioner of Police P.S. Kushwaha.
The team was at Maliwal&rsquo;s residence in central Delhi for nearly four and a half hours.
AAP Rajya Sabha MP Swati Maliwal has accused Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal&rsquo;s aide of assault. PTI File Photo Maliwal claimed she ran out of the CM&rsquo;s residence and called the police immediately after the incident.
Kejriwal was present at his residence when the incident took place, she added.
Advertisement Maliwal broke down several times while giving the statement and sought strict action against Kumar.
The AAP MP on Thursday underwent medical check-up at All India Institute of Medical Sciences.
Kejriwal evades question, BJP attacks
Adding fuel to the fire, Kejriwal on Wednesday did not address Maliwal&rsquo;s allegations during a press conference.
Kejriwal, flanked by Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav and AAP Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh, evaded a question on the subject.
Singh, however, said his party has already made its stand clear on the issue.
#WATCH | Lucknow, UP: On AAP Rajya Sabha MP Swati Maliwal&#39;s assault case, AAP MP Sanjay Singh says &quot;The entire country was in pain after seeing what happened in Manipur but PM Modi was silent on the issue.

&mdash; ANI (@ANI) May 16, 2024 Advertisement Singh, who had met Maliwal at her residence on Wednesday, said, &ldquo;The AAP is our family. Party has made its view clear.&rdquo;
He also targeted the BJP government at the Centre by raising the issue of a Manipuri woman being paraded naked, the Prajwal Revanna sex scandal and Maliwal being &ldquo;beaten up&rdquo; by police during protests by wrestlers when she was the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) chief.
Advertisement &ldquo;I want that BJP and PM should also answer on the issues I have kept before you. He (PM) should answer on the issue of Swati Maliwal, who was dragged and beaten when she went to seek justice for the female wrestlers. I just want to say don&rsquo;t play political games on the issues,&rdquo; he said.
Yadav then took the microphone and said &ldquo;there are more important things than that&rdquo;.
Then, unfolding a piece of paper, he added, &ldquo;BJP people are not with anyone, it is a &lsquo;gang&rsquo; that lodges false cases&rdquo;.
Singh at a press conference on Tuesday had accepted that Kumar had &ldquo;misbehaved&rdquo; with Maliwal.
He also labelled the incident &lsquo;highly condemnable&rsquo;, as per The Times of India.
BJP national spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia claimed that Kejriwal is the main &ldquo;criminal&rdquo; in the complaint that his aide Kumar had physically attacked Maliwal at the chief minister&rsquo;s residence, as he cited the telephone call she had made to the Delhi Police to report the matter.
&ldquo;His (Kejriwal) silence speaks a lot. Out of jail, he is more a &lsquo;goonda&rsquo; than a chief minister,&rdquo; he told reporters, noting that Kumar was seen with the chief minister in Lucknow.
Stringent action should be taken against the accused in the case, he said.
Kumar, he noted, was photographed with Kejriwal during his visit to Lucknow.
On Friday, the Delhi BJP Mahila Morcha members staged a protest near Kejriwal&rsquo;s residence.
Led by Mahila Morcha president Richa Pandey Mishra, the protesters, who were carrying bangles, demanded Kejriwal&rsquo;s resignation.
Mishra said the Mahila Morcha wanted to hand over the bangles to Kejriwal for keeping mum over the incident with Maliwal that occurred at his official residence.
“Arvind Kejriwal should be ashamed. He should resign from his post and apologise to the country. Swati Maliwal should get justice,&quot; a Mahila Morcha member told PTI.
The Mahila Morcha of the Delhi BJP also extended support to Maliwal, writing a letter to her saying the incident was a matter of honour of women in the country.
A team of the Delhi Police also turned up at Kejriwal&rsquo;s residence on Friday, as per India Today.
&lsquo;BJP conspiracy to frame Kejirwal&rsquo;
Meanwhile, the AAP has claimed the case is a &lsquo;BJP conspiracy to frame Kejriwal.&rsquo;
Senior AAP leader Atishi at a press conference said, &ldquo;Today a video has surfaced that has exposed the lie of Maliwal. In her FIR, she has said she was brutally assaulted and she was in pain, and buttons of her shirt were torn. A video that has surfaced shows an entirely different reality.&rdquo;
Atishi said the video shows Maliwal &ldquo;comfortably sitting in the drawing room&rdquo; and &ldquo;threatening the security staff&rdquo;, and that &ldquo;her clothes were not torn&rdquo;.
&ldquo;The video shows her threatening Kumar. The charges levelled by Maliwal are baseless. Maliwal insisted on meeting Kejriwal. She is Rajya Sabha MP and she should know that the CM has a busy schedule. Kumar told her that the chief minister is busy and unable to meet her. She shouted at him, pushed him and tried to enter the residential portion of the CM House,&rdquo; she claimed.
&ldquo;The whole incident proves that it was a BJP conspiracy and Swati Maliwal was made its face to frame Kejriwal,&rdquo; she alleged.
Asked about Singh accepting misbehaviour with Maliwal, Atishi said, &ldquo;AAP MP Sanjay Singh met Maliwal and he had only her version. But now this video has brought out the truth.&rdquo;

Now, it’s time to shift attention to the results. Before the results are announced on 4 June, here’s what the exit polls reveal.
Most exit polls are predicting a return of the Narendra Modi-led NDA government, winning over 350 seats, with the Opposition’s INDI Alliance managing somewhere between 125 and 150. News18 conducted its own mega exit poll, according to which NDA has bagged 355-370 seats, while the INDI Alliance has won 125-140 seats.
Advertisement But how has the NDA fared against the INDI Alliance in each state? We break through the clutter and present the results of the News18 mega exit poll in quick, easy graphics.
NORTH
The NDA, as per News18&rsquo;s exit poll, will continue its dominance in the north. In Uttar Pradesh, the NDA is poised to win 68-71 of the 80 seats, while the INDI Alliance is predicted to win nine-12 seats.
In Bihar, the NDA, of which Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s JDU is a part, will be bagging 31-34 seats, while INDI Alliance is believed to get six-nine seats. Delhi and Haryana is all about the NDA once again.
SOUTH
In the South, it seems a Narendra Modi-led push has helped the BJP. Exit polls predict an improved performance of the BJP in the five southern states. It seems in Andhra Pradesh, the alliance with Chandrababu Naidu-led Telugu Desam Party has paid big dividends for the BJP, with the NDA emerging on top. In Telangana, the News18 exit poll gives BJP a big reason to smile, predicting the party to win seven-10 seats, compared to Congress’ five-eight.
Karnataka is also expected to vote overwhelmingly for the BJP, despite its preference for the Congress at the state level. In Tamil Nadu, the party is even expected to make a debut, securing between one-three seats, exit polls predict.

EAST
The News18 exit poll predicts that the BJP-led NDA will build on its 2019 performance in the east. In West Bengal, the BJP seems to be the biggest winner, with the Mamata Banerjee led TMC trailing behind. And in Assam, it&rsquo;s NDA all the way, predicted to win 10-13 seats.
Another big surprise is from the state of Odisha. The exit poll has predicted a clean sweep for the BJP. The poll predicts the BJP will win 13-15 seats, with the BJD to come in second with six-eight seats.

In the West, the BJP-led NDA is predicted to be the big winner as per the exit poll. Gujarat is the big news here with the NDA set to be sweeping all 26 seats. Meanwhile, in Maharashtra, the NDA is predicted to win 32-35 seats, with the INDI Alliance winning 15-18 seats.
In Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, it&rsquo;s all about the NDA once again. The News18 exit poll predicts 26-29 seats for the NDA out of the 29 seats. In Rajasthan, the NDA is predicted to win 18-25 seats.

What did exit polls predict in 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections? Did they get it right?,https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/what-did-exit-polls-predict-in-2014-and-2019-lok-sabha-elections-did-they-get-it-right-13777612.html,"With voting for the seventh and final phase of the Lok Sabha polls concluding today and the counting of votes scheduled for 4 June, all eyes are on the exit polls. But how did they fare in 2014 and 2019? Which pollster got it right and which missed the mark?","Voting for the seventh and final phase of the Lok Sabha polls concluded today.
Now, with the counting of votes scheduled for 4 June, all eyes are on the exit polls. The exit polls have been released at 6.30 pm.
This is in line with the Section 126A of the Representation of the People’s Act, 1951, which states that exit polls can only be aired half an hour after the completion of the final phase of voting.
Advertisement But what did they predict in 2014 and 2019? And how accurate are exit polls really?
Let’s take a closer look:
2014
Going into 2014, pollsters were under some pressure.
After all, the exit polls had failed to get it right in back-to-back Lok Sabha elections.
In 2004, the polls predicated that the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA, which was relying on the ‘India shining’ campaign, would win big.
However, the Congress made a huge comeback in 2004.
In 2009, the exit polls predicted the UPA would get the most seats, but that the result would be a hung Parliament.
The Congress-led coalition defied the odds yet again with the Grand Old Party itself getting 200 seats.
In 2014, all the exit polls favoured the BJP-led NDA under Narendra Modi.
For NDA
The News24-Chanakya poll predicted that the NDA would nab 340 seats, while the India Today-Cicero poll gave the coalition 272 seats. The CNN-IBN-CSDS said the alliance would win 280 seats, while the Times Now poll gave the NDA.
The ABP News-Nielsen predicted 274 seats for the NDA, while the NDTV-Hansa Research estimated 279 seats for the NDA.
For UPA
For the UPA, the India Today-Cicero pollster predicted 115 seats, while News 24-Chanakya estimated 101 seats. The CNN-IBN-CSDS gave the alliance 97 seats, while Times Now projected 148 seats.
Advertisement The ABP News-Nielsen said the UPA would win 97 seats, while NDTV-Hansa Research said the alliance would net 103 seats.
Pollsters seemed to underestimate the hunger for change in the public mind as well as the sheer scale of the NDA’s victory and the UPA’s defeat.
Of all the pollsters, the News24-Chanakya was most on the money.
Advertisement The NDA would go on to win a massive 336 seats with the BJP itself crossing the half-way mark in Parliament and netting 282 seats.
The UPA, on the other hand, would be reduced to just 60 seats with the Congress winning 44 seats by its lonesome.
2019 polls
In 2019, most pollsters predicted that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA government would return – albeit with a reduced margin.
For NDA
The India Today-Axis pollster predicted that the NDA would win between 339 and 365 seats, while the News 24-Today’s Chanakya gave the alliance 350 seats.
The News18-IPSOS poll said the NDA would net 336 seats, while Times Now-VMR predicted 306 seats for the NDA.
The India TV-CNX pollster estimated 300 seats for the alliance, while the Sudarshan News poll gave the NDA 305 seats.
Advertisement For UPA
Meanwhile, for the UPA, the India Today-Axi poll predicted between 77 and 108 seats, while the News 24-Today’s Chanakya estimated 95 seats.
The News18-IPSOS poll said the UPA would win 82 seats, while the Times Now-VMR poll gave the alliance 132 seats.
The India TV-CNX predicted 120 seats for the UPA, while Sudarshan News estimated the alliance would net 124 seats.
The India Today-Axis gave the UPA between 77 and 108 seats, while News 24-Today’s Chanakya predicted 95 seats.
Most of the pollsters yet again failed to gauge the popularity of the BJP-led NDA.
Advertisement The NDA, incredibly, ended up bettering its 2014 tally in a resounding vote of confidence in Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The alliance won 352 seats with the BJP itself winning 303 seats.
Meanwhile, the Congress-led UPA expanded its tally to 91 seats with the grand old party winning 52 seats – but it was nothing to write home about.
The News 24-Today’s Chanakya was yet again the most accurate pollster.
Are exit polls accurate?
Not necessarily.
As noted above, pollsters have been off the mark with remarkable frequency in at least four recent Lok Sabha elections including 2004 and 2009.
Exit polls are also often condemned for being biased, relying on skewed data or improper sample size, and being sponsored or politically motivated, Business Standard.
The Economic Times quoted TK Arun as saying, “Exit polls are tricky in India. Indians are prudent people. Why would they tell a pollster anything other than what they figure out the pollster wants to hear? Suppose he voted Congress, and says so to the pollster, the BJP wins the election and extracts from pollsters details of all those who said they voted Congress, what mayhem might not follow? Why take the risk? Indians can be rational when the issue at stake is lack of faith as well.”
In short, exit polls can be hazardous to a political junkie’s health.

Lok Sabha Election 2024: How are exit polls conducted and are they accurate?,https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-are-exit-polls-conducted-how-accurate-are-exit-polls-lok-sabha-elections-2024-exit-polls-general-elections-13777162.html,"The largest democratic exercise in the world, India&rsquo;s 18th Lok Sabha Elections, concludes today. Following the 44-day electoral process, exit polls will commence, providing predictions on the likely victors and the extent of their triumph. What are these polls? Do they always get it right?","India&rsquo;s 18th Lok Sabha Elections, the largest democratic exercise on the planet, will conclude on 1 June, 2024 as the seventh phase comes to a close . As the lengthy 44-day electoral process ends, attention will shift to exit polls, which are expected to provide insights into the election outcomes starting from 6:30 pm on 1 June.
Exit polls are crucial for gauging the mood of the electorate and predicting the likely winners before the official results are declared. However, their accuracy and methodology are often subjects of debate and scrutiny.
Advertisement What is the methodology behind exit polls?
Exit polls are conducted by surveying voters immediately after they cast their votes. This method contrasts with opinion polls, which are conducted before the elections to gather voters&rsquo; views on various issues and candidates. Exit polls aim to provide a snapshot of voting trends, influenced by various factors such as issues, personalities, and party loyalties.
The methodology of exit polls involves interviewing voters outside polling stations using a structured questionnaire. This approach relies on the voters&rsquo; recent experiences, increasing the likelihood of obtaining accurate responses.

AP The data collected is then analysed to estimate vote shares and predict seat outcomes. These polls are typically conducted by private firms or media organisations rather than government agencies.
How has technology changed conducting exit polls?
Technological advancements have significantly influenced the conduct of exit polls. Techniques such as call-backs to respondents, images of interviews being conducted, phone calls from the field, and WhatsApp groups have enhanced data collection and analysis.
Despite these advancements, ensuring the accuracy of predictions remains challenging due to the complex and diverse nature of the Indian electorate.

AP Structured questionnaires are vital for coherent data collection and systematic analysis, reported Indian Express. The Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) emphasises the importance of representative samples in ensuring accurate predictions. A large sample size is crucial, but the representativeness of the sample is equally important.
Advertisement What challenges are faced while conducting exit polls?
Estimating vote shares and predicting seat outcomes are the primary challenges in conducting exit polls. The swing model, which relies on past election results, is influenced by various factors such as geographic location, caste, religion, and economic class.
Changes in political alliances between elections can also affect predictions. The prediction process is labour-intensive and time-consuming, as it involves making estimates for each seat.

AP The complexity of swings increases with the number of political players. For example, the BJP and JD(U) alliance in Bihar poses a challenge for the swing model. Over- or under-representation of diverse voter sections can impact the accuracy of estimates.
Advertisement How accurate are exit polls?
The accuracy of exit polls depends on various factors beyond sample size. The representativeness of the sample, the methodology used, and the ability to account for diverse voter profiles are critical. Some agencies rely on innovative methods, such as eliminating certain constituencies from the poll, to improve accuracy.
Also Read: Predictions, predilections, and Indian general elections For instance, the Lokniti-CSDS uses post-poll surveys with large sample sizes but echoes the need for representative samples. Their predictions have varied in accuracy, highlighting the complexities involved in electoral predictions.
Have exit polls ever got it wrong?
Historically, exit polls have had mixed accuracy. Some notable instances where exit polls diverged significantly from actual results include:
Advertisement 2004 Lok Sabha Elections: Exit polls predicted a majority for the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA government. However, the actual results saw the NDA falling short of expectations.
Delhi Assembly Elections 2015: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) secured a sweeping victory with 67 out of 70 seats, which was underestimated by exit polls.
Bihar Assembly Elections 2015: Exit polls predicted a close race, but the RJD-JDU-Congress coalition won decisively.
UP Assembly Elections 2017: Despite exit polls predicting a hung assembly, the BJP won over 300 seats.
2014 Lok Sabha Elections: Exit polls did not foresee the BJP achieving an outright majority, which it did by crossing the 272-mark on its own.
In India, exit polls are regulated under Section 126A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. This section prohibits the conduct and publication of exit polls during the polling period to avoid influencing voters.

Why are exit polls released after all votes are cast? Why are they relevant?,https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-are-exit-polls-released-after-all-votes-are-cast-why-are-they-relevant-13776094.html,Exit polls are essentially quick interviews with voters.

The seventh and final phase of the Lok Sabha polls is underway with 57 parliamentary constituencies set to cast their vote across eight states and union territories.
The counting for the Lok Sabha Elections 2024 will take place on 4 June.
But what do we know about exit polls? What is their history? Why are they relevant? And what about their rules?

What are they?
Exit polls are essentially quick interviews with voters.
They are usually conducted right after voters exit the polls on voting day – as opposed to opinion polls which are conducted beforehand.
The idea behind them is to offer a snapshot of the voters’ concerns. They are aimed at predicting which party is likely to come to power.
Several news channels and agencies in India conduct exit polls – with varying degrees of success.
As per Business Standard, their accuracy depends on a slew of factors including structured questionnaires, in-person or telephonic interviews of random people for fairness, sample size, demographic representation, data compilation, and count method.
The first exit poll was conducted in 1957 by the Indian Institute of Public Opinion.
The group conducted an exit poll during the second Lok Sabha elections.
As per Hindustan Times, it was the Delhi-based Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) that pioneered in the 1960s.
But it was another two decades before exit polls began being taken seriously in the media.
This is when psephologist Prannoy Roy teamed up with David Butler.
Advertisement Roy, Butler and Ashok Lahiri would go on to publish a landmark book The Compendium of Indian Elections.
State-run Doordarshan asking the CSDS to conduct a countrywide exit poll in 1996 also brought exit polls further into the mainstream.
“Without a structured questionnaire, the data can neither be collected coherently nor be analysed systematically to arrive at vote share estimates,” Indian Express quoted Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) director Sanjay Kumar as saying.
What are the rules for exit polls?
Exit polls are governed by The Representation of People Act, 1951.
Section 126 A of the act restricts publication and dissemination of exit polls results.
Advertisement Exit polls are usually conducted right after voters exit the polls on voting day – as opposed to opinion polls which are conducted beforehand. PTI It states, “No person shall conduct any exit poll and publish or publicise by means of the print or electronic media or disseminate in any other manner, whatsoever, the result of any exit poll during such period, as may be notified by the Election Commission in this regard.”
It adds that in case of a general election, the period may commence from the beginning of the hours fixed for the poll on the first day and continue till half an hour after the closing of the poll in all the States and Union territories.
According to Business Standard, this is done so that exit polls don’t influence voters or voting patterns.
Advertisement Those who violate this provision can be sentenced to a prison term of up to two years, a fine or both.
The Election Commission first issued guidelines on exit polls in 1998. The EC under Article 324 of the Constitution barred newspapers and television news channels from publishing or broadcasting results of opinion and exit polls between 5 pm on 14 February 1998 and 5 pm on 7 March 1998. The first phase in that year’s general elections began on 16 February 1998, and the final phase began on 7 March.
As per Economic Times, the EC in 2022 said news broadcasters must not air any final, formal and definite results &ldquo;until such results are formally announced by the Election Commission of India, unless such results are carried with clear disclaimer that they are unofficial or incomplete or partial results or projections which should not be taken as final results.&rdquo;
Advertisement Why are exit polls relevant?
Because people want to know which party and candidates are likely to win &ndash; and quickly.
However, critics say that they are often left wanting when it comes to accuracy.
According to Business Standard, exit polls are also often condemned for being biased, relying on skewed data or improper sample size, and being sponsored or politically motivated. The Economic Times quoted TK Arun as saying, &ldquo;Exit polls are tricky in India. Indians are prudent people. Why would they tell a pollster anything other than what they figure out the pollster wants to hear? Suppose he voted Congress, and says so to the pollster, the BJP wins the election and extracts from pollsters details of all those who said they voted Congress, what mayhem might not follow? Why take the risk? Indians can be rational when the issue at stake is lack of faith as well.&rdquo;
In the past, exit polls have had both hits and misses galore.
According to Hindustan Times, except for the 1998 and 2014 polls, at least four Lok Sabha polls have gotten it badly wrong.
This includes two back-to-back predictions in 2004 and 2009.
The 2004 exit polls in particular were a massive failure with the pollsters completely missing the Congress coming back to power as the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA with its ‘India Shining’ slogan lost its majority.
All exit polls predicted a win for the BJP.
Again in 2009, while most pollsters gave the edge to the UPA, they completely missed a huge swing in its favour.
The UPA added 40 more seats to its tally.
A man looks at a television screen showing exit poll results after the last phase of the general election in Ahmedabad on 19 May 2019. File photo/Reuters In 2014, the BJP won over 330 seats.
While most pollsters said then prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi and the BJP-led NDA would cross the 272 mark, almost none of them forecast the decisive performance.
It was only pollster Chanakya, who predicted 340 seats for the NDA, that came close to getting it spot on.
In 2019, most pollsters predicted that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA government would return &ndash; albeit with a reduced margin compared to the previous election. Of course, we know that the pollsters yet again underestimated the strength of the BJP-led NDA, which would nab 353 seats.

"Predictions, predilections, and Indian general elections",https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/predictions-predilections-and-indian-general-elections-13775669.html,Election predictions are notoriously hard due to the changing nature of the parameters,"Predictions are awfully difficult, even with the reassuring crunch of numbers! And yet, they are our fatal predilection, whether the challenge is for our pleasure or for that of others. Be it the stock market, astrology, or gambling, our insatiable curiosity for the mysterious and unknown is probably what propels such abandonment.
Take the ongoing Lok Sabha polls, going on for perhaps too long now, and the concomitant barrage of prophecies from TV channels, from YouTube “influenczars” and from downright bored individuals, all of whom shoot off their incendiary numbers into the tinder of social media. These soothsayers speak from relative ignorance and mostly from a fascination for a particular party, be they pidis or bhakts.They speak with the confidence that they can actually fool all the people all the time, with Abraham Lincoln being the ultimate fool, poor man. What is most horrendous is that all of them have declared random numbers like 180, 200, 250, 272, 303, 320, 362, 370, and the ace of spades, 400, long before all the votes have come in. This is why I liken election predictions in India to gambling. It is matka guessing in a satta bazar. Parrot talk, or tarot talk, it leads to no concrete outcome. It does not affect the choices made by the voters, choices one suspects were cast in stone, long before the elections were even announced. And yet, these delirious djinns persist, as their minds are made up too. The happy side to this sad fantasy is that it is time-bound, and we can all reclaim our normal lives on June 4.
Advertisement Lighter comments aside, there is a more serious side to prediction, based on the assumption that future events are influenced to some or a greater extent by what has happened before. History is our greatest teacher. The art and science of good prediction lie in identifying which past (or present) event will likely influence an event to come. Let us take the Indian monsoon, an annual event of major economic importance to our nation, and one that has just begun this year. It would help the government enormously if it knew a few months in advance if the monsoon were to be normal, below average, or will punch above its weight.
At present, the Indian monsoon is predicted using a combination of atmospheric models, sea surface temperature analysis, historical data, and satellite observations. Key factors include the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, the Indian Ocean Dipole, and wind patterns. Advanced computational models simulate these variables to forecast rainfall and monsoon onset accurately. However, there are totally different methods of monsoon prediction that would not be considered ‘scientific’ by western definition, but are yet chillingly accurate. Traditionally, some Indian communities predict the monsoon by observing the nesting behaviour of certain birds, like the Indian weaver bird (Baya Weaver). It is believed that if these birds build their nests on higher branches, a heavier monsoon will ensue. Conversely, lower nests indicate lighter rainfall. This method relies on the birds&rsquo; instinctive response to environmental cues, and seems to be largely reliable. Nature lovers might like to correlate this occurrence with the Japanese kō or 72 micro-seasons, for further poetic justification.
Advertisement Prediction is a key aspect of science, and the smaller the number of known events, phenomena, and parameters used to predict a large number of future events accurately, the better the value of the prediction. At the risk of introducing an equation in this column, one can say the value of a prediction, V = (N/n) – 1, where one is able to correctly predict N outcomes with n parameters. According to this equation, the value of a prediction is zero if one needs n parameters to predict N outcomes.
Let’s apply this equation to the present Lok Sabha election. We could say that N = 543, in other words, we want to correctly predict the results from 543 constituencies. How many parameters would we need, or what is the value of n, for a good prediction? What our present-day pollsters are doing, in trying to improve the accuracy of their guesses, is to increase the number of parameters to absurd levels. They ask whether all the Muslim women in Kishanganj will vote like their menfolk, whether the hot summer days in Ramagundam will harm voting, or whether all the Gounders in Kovai will stay loyal to the AIADMK. The problem with such micro-parameters is that they cannot be quantified properly. Informal surveys on the ground may not be the answer because all respondents may not answer truthfully. We see ludicrous statements from politicians—some say that low turnouts hurt the BJP, while others say that low turnouts hurt the Congress. Others say that a low or high turnout may help or hurt a party, depending on the state. Still others say that whatever happens, Congress is winning. The problem with any or all of this is that none of it can be either proven or disproven—this makes it non-scientific. The reader will appreciate that as n increases with all these unprovable parameters, the value of the prediction quickly goes to zero. It is easier to say that there is only one parameter in this election, and that is the prime minister himself. Applying the equation, the value of my prediction is (543/1) – 1 = 542, which in practical terms means a sizable majority for the BJP. I think I’m doing pretty well for myself with this prediction. June 4 will tell.
Advertisement What I would have liked to see, and what seems missing, is a more accurate assessment of ‘swing’ constituencies in bellwether states. No expert needs to predict that the BJP will win in Gandhinagar or that it will lose in South Kolkata. On the other hand, if the BJP were to win in Thiruvananthapuram, Bengaluru Rural, Hyderabad, or Central Chennai, this would signify that winds of change are blowing across the country. The very high voter turnout in Baramulla is another pointer. An ability to extrapolate from this to an accurate prediction about the Kashmir Valley in particular and the country in general, is what is missing. Once again, what I would like to see on June 4 is how soon any particular TV channel is able to call the election, say by 9, 10, or 11 am? The sooner it is able to do this, the better its reports will be and the less fluff and bluff.
Advertisement Election predictions are notoriously hard due to the changing nature of the parameters, something we do not usually see in science. The Truman-Dewey US presidential election of 1945, was made memorable by the photograph of the victor, Harry Truman, brandishing a copy of the Chicago Tribune that screamed the wrong headline, “Dewey defeats Truman”. So close was the vote. At the end of World War II, the UK voted against Winston Churchill, their doughty PM, who had saved them from Nazi tyranny. He was hustled out of office when the Labour Party won by a substantial majority. Can we ever imagine a similar situation in India? And yet, some of our own elections have indeed yielded surprising results, and one recollects 1971, 1977, and 2019, when the decisiveness of the mandate was quite something else.

Beyond the Lines | Indian elections: What the biggest show on earth can teach the world,https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/beyond-the-lines-indian-elections-what-the-biggest-show-on-earth-can-teach-the-world-13773225.html,"Not only are the Indian general elections the largest poll show on earth — they are also the most intensely contested and certainly, sets the bar for America to follow this November","This was going to be the global election year that decides the fate of the world. This was also going to be the biggest election in the world’s biggest democracy. With over 900 million broadband subscribers, the Indian voter is more plugged into the commentary of the voting analysis, trends and outcomes.
The cacophony of election analysis is hardwired into the heads of Indian citizens through their phones and devices, their choices dictated by opinions and beliefs, which in turn has been an outcome of results seen in the last five years. Yet, when I went to cast my vote this Monday, the booth-level machinery was so well-oiled and efficient that beyond the cacophony of election sloganeering and digital pyrotechnics, the unassuming power of silent citizens dutifully stepping up to vote on their appointed day, sans drama or hyperbole, held up a useful guide for the rest of the world to emulate.
Advertisement India, the world’s most populous democracy, is currently holding its general election over a seven-phase period that continues for seven weeks. Indians can vote between 19 April and 1 June, with the results set to be declared on 4 June.
The World Decides in 2024
Over fifty elections take place in 2024, including some of the most impacting ones such as the US, Russia, India, Taiwan. Fifty-one per cent of the world will either have a new dispensation or continue with the existing one. As elections take place across the world, the festival of democracy in India is expected to be among the keenly contested, fair and well organised ones in the world.
These elections have also proved that India sets consistent standards in choosing their leaders, disproving a biased opinion about democracy and elections that certain western thinking has held towards India. Using a template of a fairness score to evaluate the independence of elections in countries, as a well-known western publication recently did, reduces the process of choices in elections to a rating number which can both end up being biased and patronising, and is dictated by a long-held expectation that Indian polls are simultaneously cantankerous and exotic — a work in progress democracy that promises to be civilised but is never one. It also served to quietly aid a narrative that the democratic processes in the west are superior.
Advertisement Why India’s Free Elections Trumps West’s Bias
Take for instance, the freedom and fairness score accorded to India’s elections, which is 0.53 and compare it to the other nations in their leadup to the elections. Mexico is a country heading for elections this year. In this election cycle, 30 candidates have already been assassinated, according to data from the research firm Laboratorio Electoral. In 2021, 30 candidates were killed while in 2018, the elections saw 24 killings. These elections are expected to be among the most violent. According to western pundits, Mexico has a freedom and fairness score of 0.75 in the conduct of elections, which indicates the elections are more ‘just and fair’ than in India. Parts of western media has been unduly harsh on India, rating its fairness score of elections at 0.53.
Advertisement In Indonesia, the electoral process is still dominated by corrupt or influential leaders who grew powerful during the authoritarian rule of Suharto. Democracy is new, and power oscillated between influential stakeholders, till Joko Widodo, an outsider, broke the stranglehold. Thereafter, a general took over as President — one the west has accused of human rights abuses. Interestingly, Indonesia’s freedom and fairness score stands at 0.68, higher than India. Which means that the credibility of Indian elections is just about better than the banana republics — an assumption that betrays the negative bias of such studies.
The US, rated high in freedom and fairness index by the publication, struggled under serious allegations of tampering and influence by Russia and the subsequent response of Trump supporters laying siege in Washington DC after losing the elections indicated a democracy that was functional but not civilised. On the other hand, far from the history of some of the nations, who have either embraced dysfunctional democracy along the way or seem to be falling by the wayside in terms of their law and order situation in the lead up to the elections, India has maintained an enviable record of holding free and fair elections over seven decades.
Advertisement The Decisive Indian Vote
From the general election held in 1951-52 in which 17.5 crore Indians, voted in the elections to the 18th Lok Sabha that are under way, the process has evolved and matured along with Indian democracy over the decades. So have the voters graduated, from being largely illiterate to being well informed and technically savvy while making choices.
The CEC explained why the voluntary nature of casting votes means that the ECI operates ‘in an entirely persuasive space, inviting the citizens to volunteer to become part of the electoral roll and, thereafter, through systematic voter awareness programmes, motivates them to exercise their franchise.’ There is a high elector to population ratio which underpins the discipline, patience and belief that Indian voters have demonstrated in executing the process. The power of Indian elections demonstrates a growing, emerging India that is willing and ready to show how democracy is a proven political system in this world. Take for instance the example of Jammu and Kashmir.
Advertisement Since 1989, all earlier elections in the region had been plagued by violence and a tendence towards anarchy, influenced by separatist parties. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Anantnag, Srinagar and Baramulla — the Lok Sabha seats — recorded dismal attendance.
Baramulla recorded 46 per cent voting in 1996. Thereafter it has struggled to have voters on election days. Twenty-eight years later, 59 per cent of Baramulla showed up to vote on polling day, breaking the previous record.
This time, local political leaders have addressed large crowds who are keen to be a part of the time-tested process of democracy and express their opinions at the poll booths, unlike earlier times when boycotts dominated Kashmiri elections and the turnout, cowed down by the gun, often struggled to crawl out of single digit percentage attendance.
The resolve to bring Kashmir out of a rut of decades-old militancy by taking the gun out of the equation has helped locals trust the power of the ballot in making lives better instead of being ruled by fear of militancy. There is a growing curiosity about the choices available in a democracy through the power of the ballot, which many people in the state now see value in, unlike across the border where democracy is in shambles and offers no choices.
Younger India: 18 Million First-Time Voters
One of the key aspects in these elections is the addition of over 2-crore young first time voters. These voters, in each successive edition, are going to boost a voting population that consumes digital information and has a strong sense of independent opinion. A keen interest among young voters has led to parties canvassing through digital platforms. An increasingly politically conscious, intelligent but less patient voter base has meant that parties have had to address more matured issues – which also tells us how India has travelled a fair distance from the days when Garibi Hatao was a dominating slogan.
The voter turnout, lower in the early stages, yet reflects an involved participation of its citizens across the country. In a country where different belief systems have held sway, the one common space where India comes together as a country is its general election. Which is why, an election season resembles a festival of choices rather than a mere mechanical process of choosing.
India Votes for the World to Emulate
In the previous national edition in 2019, the Election Commission confirmed a 67 per cent turnout. The Americans were marginally higher in the same period while voting in their elections. The Indian elections have also been among the most expensive elections, in which political parties spent more than 7 billion in 2019, higher than the spends in the US elections in that period. Not only are the Indian general elections the largest poll show on earth — they are also the most intensely contested and certainly, sets the bar for America to follow this November.
While wars and conflicts singe the world in most parts and certain nations have gone berserk losing their way while making choices, India proves yet again that this election festival of citizens is not only the biggest but also the most civilised and sane process on earth.

"Busy dousing fire on Swati Maliwal 'assault' row, AAP loses a week of Kejriwal's freedom and fought against itself than rivals",https://www.firstpost.com/india/busy-dousing-fire-on-swati-maliwal-assault-row-aap-loses-a-week-of-kejriwals-freedom-and-fought-against-itself-than-rivals-13772369.html,"Amid the escalating blame game, the focus abruptly moved from Arvind Kejriwal to Swati Maliwal and the internal feud between Maliwal and other AAP members overshadowed Kejriwal&rsquo;s continuous attacks on the prime minister and the BJP","When the Supreme Court granted interim bail to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on 10 May until 2 June, the AAP leader had a clear agenda ahead. Arrested on 21 March by the Enforcement Directorate in the liquor policy case, Kejriwal now had 21 days to capitalise on his temporary release. His primary focus would have been to generate publicity for himself and the AAP by intensifying his criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP.
Advertisement The Maliwal incident: A shift in focus
This situation progressed smoothly until the Swati Maliwal incident on 13 May. On that day, AAP Rajya Sabha MP Swati Maliwal accused Bibhav Kumar, a member of Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal&rsquo;s personal staff of misconduct. Following her allegations, the Delhi Police arrested Kejriwal&rsquo;s private assistant Bibhav Kumar, igniting a dual conflict: AAP versus BJP and Swati Maliwal versus the rest of AAP.
Amid the escalating blame game, two significant shifts occurred. First, the focus abruptly moved from Arvind Kejriwal to Swati Maliwal. Second, the internal feud between Maliwal and other AAP members overshadowed Kejriwal&rsquo;s continuous attacks on the prime minister and the BJP.
Significantly, this incident consumed a crucial portion of Kejriwal&rsquo;s 21 days of freedom with an entire week diverted to the Maliwal controversy.
Strategic reorientation
Regardless of whether AAP inadvertently fell into a trap or recognised the situation belatedly, Kejriwal understood the pressing need to redirect attention back to himself. He needed to refocus the battle onto BJP territory and distance the party from the Maliwal incident. Whether it was genuine support for his long-time aide Kumar or a strategy to revitalise AAP, the Delhi chief minister knew that a significant move was necessary to reclaim the spotlight.
What better way to do it than challenge Prime Minister Modi to arrest all AAP leaders as he announced on Saturday that he would march to BJP headquarters in Delhi on Sunday at noon accompanied by all the prominent leaders of his party. More the chaos better the publicity.
Advertisement Kejriwal alleged that the BJP was trying to completely destroy AAP through Operation Jhadu. He shared that people who were familiar with both the BJP and him had informed him that Prime Minister Modi acknowledged AAP&rsquo;s growing influence and the global discussion around their work. Kejriwal said that the BJP saw AAP as a potential tough challenger in several states and wanted to eliminate them. He made these statements while addressing the press at the party office on Sunday.
Importance of Delhi for AAP
Voting for all seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi is scheduled for 25 May as part of Phase 6 of the polling.
Advertisement Delhi is of paramount importance to the AAP for several reasons. It is the party&rsquo;s primary base and stronghold where it was founded and first achieved significant political success by winning the Delhi Legislative Assembly elections in 2013. Maintaining control over Delhi is essential for AAP&rsquo;s political legitimacy and influence. Furthermore, Delhi serves as a showcase for AAP&rsquo;s governance model and policies.
AAP finds itself grappling with the challenge of maintaining a focussed engagement with its diverse electorate in Delhi, which encompasses various socioeconomic groups. Amid its efforts to highlight flagship programmes such as mohalla clinics, subsidised electricity and its work in government schools, the controversy surrounding Maliwal has diverted public attention from these areas which AAP would have wanted to bring in front of the voters.
Advertisement Whether the Maliwal incident is indeed a premeditated attack on AAP as the party alleges or simply a coincidence only time will reveal. However, there is no doubt that it has placed AAP in a defensive position precisely when it was gearing up for a strong offensive. Whether it&rsquo;s a calculated move by a political mastermind or just an unfortunate stroke of fate remains uncertain for now.

How Swati Maliwal row is disrupting Arvind Kejriwal’s campaign for Lok Sabha polls,https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/swati-maliwal-row-arvind-kejriwal-13772041.html,"While Arvind Kejriwal&rsquo;s release from jail to campaign for the Lok Sabha polls came as a big relief to the AAP and the Opposition, the Swati Maliwal controversy has cast a pall over proceedings. While the Delhi chief minister has remained mum over the matter, the party has claimed that there is a &lsquo;BJP conspiracy&rsquo; to frame him","Arvind Kejriwal must have felt great relief when he was granted bail by the Supreme Court.
The apex court granted the Delhi chief minister bail in the alleged money laundering case in order to campaign for the Lok Sabha polls.
But the controversy over Swati Maliwal has dogged Kejriwal at every step.
Maliwal, the AAP&rsquo;s Rajya Sabha MP, filed an FIR on Thursday accusing the Delhi chief minister&rsquo;s aide Bibhav Kumar of assaulting her. Advertisement The AAP has alleged a conspiracy is being hatched against Kejriwal, while the BJP has demanded stringent action against the accused.
Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at how the row has disrupted his campaign:
Kejriwal&rsquo;s release from jail was a big boost to the party and the Opposition.
The Times of India quoted Sandeep Pathak, a close aide of Kejriwal who is overseeing the AAP Lok Sabha campaign, as saying the development breathed fresh life into the party.
&ldquo;With him, the cadre feels happier, much more positive, much more charged. That’s one aspect of it. The other is that the BJP thought that they would get Kejriwal arrested and then start breaking up the AAP in Delhi and Punjab. But they miserably failed,&rdquo; the AAP Rajya Sabha MP said.
But Maliwal&rsquo;s accusations have now cast a pall over proceedings.
&ldquo;While the whole truth is not out yet, all is certainly not well inside the AAP. There have been reports of differences between Kejriwal and Maliwal for some time. There are claims that Kejriwal was not happy with Maliwal&rsquo;s absence from Delhi before and after his arrest as well as her relative silence on his arrest. Maliwal, however, was reportedly visiting her sister in the US,&rdquo; the piece stated.
It noted that if Kejriwal is sent to jail again for a long time, the party is likely to fracture. But if he is granted regular bail, he will likely be able to keep his team together.
&ldquo;What was supposed to be a few weeks of respite for Kejriwal are proving to be a testing period. His attention will now be divided between the election campaign and the party affairs,&rdquo; the piece noted.
Advertisement On Wednesday some people also raised slogans during Kejriwal&rsquo;s road show in Chandni Chowk against Kumar, as per The Times of India.
&lsquo;Slapped, hit in stomach&rsquo;
Maliwal in her FIR filed Thursday claimed she was &ldquo;slapped, hit in the stomach and kicked&rdquo; by Kumar.
The FIR was registered after Maliwal&rsquo;s statement was recorded by a two-member team led by Additional Commissioner of Police P.S. Kushwaha.
The team was at Maliwal&rsquo;s residence in central Delhi for nearly four and a half hours.
AAP Rajya Sabha MP Swati Maliwal has accused Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal&rsquo;s aide of assault. PTI File Photo Maliwal claimed she ran out of the CM&rsquo;s residence and called the police immediately after the incident.
Kejriwal was present at his residence when the incident took place, she added.
Advertisement Maliwal broke down several times while giving the statement and sought strict action against Kumar.
The AAP MP on Thursday underwent medical check-up at All India Institute of Medical Sciences.
Kejriwal evades question, BJP attacks
Adding fuel to the fire, Kejriwal on Wednesday did not address Maliwal&rsquo;s allegations during a press conference.
Kejriwal, flanked by Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav and AAP Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh, evaded a question on the subject.
Singh, however, said his party has already made its stand clear on the issue.

&mdash; ANI (@ANI) May 16, 2024 Advertisement Singh, who had met Maliwal at her residence on Wednesday, said, &ldquo;The AAP is our family. Party has made its view clear.&rdquo;
He also targeted the BJP government at the Centre by raising the issue of a Manipuri woman being paraded naked, the Prajwal Revanna sex scandal and Maliwal being &ldquo;beaten up&rdquo; by police during protests by wrestlers when she was the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) chief.
Advertisement &ldquo;I want that BJP and PM should also answer on the issues I have kept before you. He (PM) should answer on the issue of Swati Maliwal, who was dragged and beaten when she went to seek justice for the female wrestlers. I just want to say don&rsquo;t play political games on the issues,&rdquo; he said.
Yadav then took the microphone and said &ldquo;there are more important things than that&rdquo;.
Then, unfolding a piece of paper, he added, &ldquo;BJP people are not with anyone, it is a &lsquo;gang&rsquo; that lodges false cases&rdquo;.
Singh at a press conference on Tuesday had accepted that Kumar had &ldquo;misbehaved&rdquo; with Maliwal.
He also labelled the incident &lsquo;highly condemnable&rsquo;, as per The Times of India.
BJP national spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia claimed that Kejriwal is the main &ldquo;criminal&rdquo; in the complaint that his aide Kumar had physically attacked Maliwal at the chief minister&rsquo;s residence, as he cited the telephone call she had made to the Delhi Police to report the matter.
&ldquo;His (Kejriwal) silence speaks a lot. Out of jail, he is more a &lsquo;goonda&rsquo; than a chief minister,&rdquo; he told reporters, noting that Kumar was seen with the chief minister in Lucknow.
Stringent action should be taken against the accused in the case, he said.
Kumar, he noted, was photographed with Kejriwal during his visit to Lucknow.
On Friday, the Delhi BJP Mahila Morcha members staged a protest near Kejriwal&rsquo;s residence.
Led by Mahila Morcha president Richa Pandey Mishra, the protesters, who were carrying bangles, demanded Kejriwal&rsquo;s resignation.
Mishra said the Mahila Morcha wanted to hand over the bangles to Kejriwal for keeping mum over the incident with Maliwal that occurred at his official residence.
“Arvind Kejriwal should be ashamed. He should resign from his post and apologise to the country. Swati Maliwal should get justice,&quot; a Mahila Morcha member told PTI.
The Mahila Morcha of the Delhi BJP also extended support to Maliwal, writing a letter to her saying the incident was a matter of honour of women in the country.
A team of the Delhi Police also turned up at Kejriwal&rsquo;s residence on Friday, as per India Today.
&lsquo;BJP conspiracy to frame Kejirwal&rsquo;
Meanwhile, the AAP has claimed the case is a &lsquo;BJP conspiracy to frame Kejriwal.&rsquo;
Senior AAP leader Atishi at a press conference said, &ldquo;Today a video has surfaced that has exposed the lie of Maliwal. In her FIR, she has said she was brutally assaulted and she was in pain, and buttons of her shirt were torn. A video that has surfaced shows an entirely different reality.&rdquo;
Atishi said the video shows Maliwal &ldquo;comfortably sitting in the drawing room&rdquo; and &ldquo;threatening the security staff&rdquo;, and that &ldquo;her clothes were not torn&rdquo;.
&ldquo;The video shows her threatening Kumar. The charges levelled by Maliwal are baseless. Maliwal insisted on meeting Kejriwal. She is Rajya Sabha MP and she should know that the CM has a busy schedule. Kumar told her that the chief minister is busy and unable to meet her. She shouted at him, pushed him and tried to enter the residential portion of the CM House,&rdquo; she claimed.
&ldquo;The whole incident proves that it was a BJP conspiracy and Swati Maliwal was made its face to frame Kejriwal,&rdquo; she alleged.
Asked about Singh accepting misbehaviour with Maliwal, Atishi said, &ldquo;AAP MP Sanjay Singh met Maliwal and he had only her version. But now this video has brought out the truth.&rdquo;

In Graphics | What News18 exit poll predicts about your state in Lok Sabha election 2024,https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/lok-sabha-elections-news18-exit-poll-state-wise-results-nda-indi-alliance-in-graphics-13777629.html,The voting in the Lok Sabha elections is over and exit polls are out. Here&rsquo;s what the News18 exit poll has predicted for the NDA and the INDI Alliance in some of the big states,"The voting for the Lok Sabha elections has come to an end and it’s been a lengthy process — seven long phases spread over six weeks. Now, it’s time to shift attention to the results. Before the results are announced on 4 June, here’s what the exit polls reveal.
Most exit polls are predicting a return of the Narendra Modi-led NDA government, winning over 350 seats, with the Opposition’s INDI Alliance managing somewhere between 125 and 150. News18 conducted its own mega exit poll, according to which NDA has bagged 355-370 seats, while the INDI Alliance has won 125-140 seats.
Advertisement But how has the NDA fared against the INDI Alliance in each state? We break through the clutter and present the results of the News18 mega exit poll in quick, easy graphics.
NORTH
The NDA, as per News18&rsquo;s exit poll, will continue its dominance in the north. In Uttar Pradesh, the NDA is poised to win 68-71 of the 80 seats, while the INDI Alliance is predicted to win nine-12 seats.
In Bihar, the NDA, of which Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s JDU is a part, will be bagging 31-34 seats, while INDI Alliance is believed to get six-nine seats. Delhi and Haryana is all about the NDA once again.
SOUTH
In the South, it seems a Narendra Modi-led push has helped the BJP. Exit polls predict an improved performance of the BJP in the five southern states. It seems in Andhra Pradesh, the alliance with Chandrababu Naidu-led Telugu Desam Party has paid big dividends for the BJP, with the NDA emerging on top. In Telangana, the News18 exit poll gives BJP a big reason to smile, predicting the party to win seven-10 seats, compared to Congress’ five-eight.
Karnataka is also expected to vote overwhelmingly for the BJP, despite its preference for the Congress at the state level. In Tamil Nadu, the party is even expected to make a debut, securing between one-three seats, exit polls predict.
Advertisement The Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) is set to sweep Kerala once, while the BJP-led NDA will open its account in the southern state.
EAST
The News18 exit poll predicts that the BJP-led NDA will build on its 2019 performance in the east. In West Bengal, the BJP seems to be the biggest winner, with the Mamata Banerjee led TMC trailing behind. And in Assam, it&rsquo;s NDA all the way, predicted to win 10-13 seats.
Another big surprise is from the state of Odisha. The exit poll has predicted a clean sweep for the BJP. The poll predicts the BJP will win 13-15 seats, with the BJD to come in second with six-eight seats.
Advertisement WEST
In the West, the BJP-led NDA is predicted to be the big winner as per the exit poll. Gujarat is the big news here with the NDA set to be sweeping all 26 seats. Meanwhile, in Maharashtra, the NDA is predicted to win 32-35 seats, with the INDI Alliance winning 15-18 seats.
In Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, it&rsquo;s all about the NDA once again. The News18 exit poll predicts 26-29 seats for the NDA out of the 29 seats. In Rajasthan, the NDA is predicted to win 18-25 seats.

Going into 2014, pollsters were under some pressure.
After all, the exit polls had failed to get it right in back-to-back Lok Sabha elections.
In 2004, the polls predicated that the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA, which was relying on the ‘India shining’ campaign, would win big.
However, the Congress made a huge comeback in 2004.
In 2009, the exit polls predicted the UPA would get the most seats, but that the result would be a hung Parliament.
The Congress-led coalition defied the odds yet again with the Grand Old Party itself getting 200 seats.
In 2014, all the exit polls favoured the BJP-led NDA under Narendra Modi.
For NDA
The News24-Chanakya poll predicted that the NDA would nab 340 seats, while the India Today-Cicero poll gave the coalition 272 seats. The CNN-IBN-CSDS said the alliance would win 280 seats, while the Times Now poll gave the NDA.
The ABP News-Nielsen predicted 274 seats for the NDA, while the NDTV-Hansa Research estimated 279 seats for the NDA.
For UPA
For the UPA, the India Today-Cicero pollster predicted 115 seats, while News 24-Chanakya estimated 101 seats. The CNN-IBN-CSDS gave the alliance 97 seats, while Times Now projected 148 seats.
Advertisement The ABP News-Nielsen said the UPA would win 97 seats, while NDTV-Hansa Research said the alliance would net 103 seats.
Pollsters seemed to underestimate the hunger for change in the public mind as well as the sheer scale of the NDA’s victory and the UPA’s defeat.
Of all the pollsters, the News24-Chanakya was most on the money.
Advertisement The NDA would go on to win a massive 336 seats with the BJP itself crossing the half-way mark in Parliament and netting 282 seats.
The UPA, on the other hand, would be reduced to just 60 seats with the Congress winning 44 seats by its lonesome.
2019 polls
In 2019, most pollsters predicted that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA government would return – albeit with a reduced margin.
For NDA
The India Today-Axis pollster predicted that the NDA would win between 339 and 365 seats, while the News 24-Today’s Chanakya gave the alliance 350 seats.
The News18-IPSOS poll said the NDA would net 336 seats, while Times Now-VMR predicted 306 seats for the NDA.
The India TV-CNX pollster estimated 300 seats for the alliance, while the Sudarshan News poll gave the NDA 305 seats.
Advertisement For UPA
Meanwhile, for the UPA, the India Today-Axi poll predicted between 77 and 108 seats, while the News 24-Today’s Chanakya estimated 95 seats.
The News18-IPSOS poll said the UPA would win 82 seats, while the Times Now-VMR poll gave the alliance 132 seats.
The India TV-CNX predicted 120 seats for the UPA, while Sudarshan News estimated the alliance would net 124 seats.
The India Today-Axis gave the UPA between 77 and 108 seats, while News 24-Today’s Chanakya predicted 95 seats.
Most of the pollsters yet again failed to gauge the popularity of the BJP-led NDA.
Advertisement The NDA, incredibly, ended up bettering its 2014 tally in a resounding vote of confidence in Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The alliance won 352 seats with the BJP itself winning 303 seats.
Meanwhile, the Congress-led UPA expanded its tally to 91 seats with the grand old party winning 52 seats – but it was nothing to write home about.
The News 24-Today’s Chanakya was yet again the most accurate pollster.
Are exit polls accurate?
Not necessarily.
As noted above, pollsters have been off the mark with remarkable frequency in at least four recent Lok Sabha elections including 2004 and 2009.
Exit polls are also often condemned for being biased, relying on skewed data or improper sample size, and being sponsored or politically motivated, Business Standard.
The Economic Times quoted TK Arun as saying, “Exit polls are tricky in India. Indians are prudent people. Why would they tell a pollster anything other than what they figure out the pollster wants to hear? Suppose he voted Congress, and says so to the pollster, the BJP wins the election and extracts from pollsters details of all those who said they voted Congress, what mayhem might not follow? Why take the risk? Indians can be rational when the issue at stake is lack of faith as well.”
In short, exit polls can be hazardous to a political junkie’s health.

Lok Sabha Election 2024: How are exit polls conducted and are they accurate?,https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-are-exit-polls-conducted-how-accurate-are-exit-polls-lok-sabha-elections-2024-exit-polls-general-elections-13777162.html,"The largest democratic exercise in the world, India&rsquo;s 18th Lok Sabha Elections, concludes today. Following the 44-day electoral process, exit polls will commence, providing predictions on the likely victors and the extent of their triumph. What are these polls? Do they always get it right?","India&rsquo;s 18th Lok Sabha Elections, the largest democratic exercise on the planet, will conclude on 1 June, 2024 as the seventh phase comes to a close . As the lengthy 44-day electoral process ends, attention will shift to exit polls, which are expected to provide insights into the election outcomes starting from 6:30 pm on 1 June.
Exit polls are crucial for gauging the mood of the electorate and predicting the likely winners before the official results are declared. However, their accuracy and methodology are often subjects of debate and scrutiny.
Advertisement What is the methodology behind exit polls?
Exit polls are conducted by surveying voters immediately after they cast their votes. This method contrasts with opinion polls, which are conducted before the elections to gather voters&rsquo; views on various issues and candidates. Exit polls aim to provide a snapshot of voting trends, influenced by various factors such as issues, personalities, and party loyalties.
The methodology of exit polls involves interviewing voters outside polling stations using a structured questionnaire. This approach relies on the voters&rsquo; recent experiences, increasing the likelihood of obtaining accurate responses.

AP The data collected is then analysed to estimate vote shares and predict seat outcomes. These polls are typically conducted by private firms or media organisations rather than government agencies.
How has technology changed conducting exit polls?
Technological advancements have significantly influenced the conduct of exit polls. Techniques such as call-backs to respondents, images of interviews being conducted, phone calls from the field, and WhatsApp groups have enhanced data collection and analysis.
Despite these advancements, ensuring the accuracy of predictions remains challenging due to the complex and diverse nature of the Indian electorate.

AP Structured questionnaires are vital for coherent data collection and systematic analysis, reported Indian Express. The Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) emphasises the importance of representative samples in ensuring accurate predictions. A large sample size is crucial, but the representativeness of the sample is equally important.
Advertisement What challenges are faced while conducting exit polls?
Estimating vote shares and predicting seat outcomes are the primary challenges in conducting exit polls. The swing model, which relies on past election results, is influenced by various factors such as geographic location, caste, religion, and economic class.
Changes in political alliances between elections can also affect predictions. The prediction process is labour-intensive and time-consuming, as it involves making estimates for each seat.

AP The complexity of swings increases with the number of political players. For example, the BJP and JD(U) alliance in Bihar poses a challenge for the swing model. Over- or under-representation of diverse voter sections can impact the accuracy of estimates.
Advertisement How accurate are exit polls?
The accuracy of exit polls depends on various factors beyond sample size. The representativeness of the sample, the methodology used, and the ability to account for diverse voter profiles are critical. Some agencies rely on innovative methods, such as eliminating certain constituencies from the poll, to improve accuracy.

Their predictions have varied in accuracy, highlighting the complexities involved in electoral predictions.
Have exit polls ever got it wrong?
Historically, exit polls have had mixed accuracy. Some notable instances where exit polls diverged significantly from actual results include:
Advertisement 2004 Lok Sabha Elections: Exit polls predicted a majority for the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA government. However, the actual results saw the NDA falling short of expectations.
Delhi Assembly Elections 2015: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) secured a sweeping victory with 67 out of 70 seats, which was underestimated by exit polls.
Bihar Assembly Elections 2015: Exit polls predicted a close race, but the RJD-JDU-Congress coalition won decisively.
UP Assembly Elections 2017: Despite exit polls predicting a hung assembly, the BJP won over 300 seats.
2014 Lok Sabha Elections: Exit polls did not foresee the BJP achieving an outright majority, which it did by crossing the 272-mark on its own.
In India, exit polls are regulated under Section 126A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. This section prohibits the conduct and publication of exit polls during the polling period to avoid influencing voters.

Why are exit polls released after all votes are cast? Why are they relevant?,https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-are-exit-polls-released-after-all-votes-are-cast-why-are-they-relevant-13776094.html,Exit polls are essentially quick interviews with voters.

The seventh and final phase of the Lok Sabha polls is underway with 57 parliamentary constituencies set to cast their vote across eight states and union territories.
The counting for the Lok Sabha Elections 2024 will take place on 4 June.
But what do we know about exit polls? What is their history? Why are they relevant? And what about their rules?

What are they?
Exit polls are essentially quick interviews with voters.
They are usually conducted right after voters exit the polls on voting day – as opposed to opinion polls which are conducted beforehand.
The idea behind them is to offer a snapshot of the voters’ concerns. They are aimed at predicting which party is likely to come to power.
Several news channels and agencies in India conduct exit polls – with varying degrees of success.
As per Business Standard, their accuracy depends on a slew of factors including structured questionnaires, in-person or telephonic interviews of random people for fairness, sample size, demographic representation, data compilation, and count method.
The first exit poll was conducted in 1957 by the Indian Institute of Public Opinion.
The group conducted an exit poll during the second Lok Sabha elections.
As per Hindustan Times, it was the Delhi-based Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) that pioneered in the 1960s.
But it was another two decades before exit polls began being taken seriously in the media.
This is when psephologist Prannoy Roy teamed up with David Butler.
Advertisement Roy, Butler and Ashok Lahiri would go on to publish a landmark book The Compendium of Indian Elections.
State-run Doordarshan asking the CSDS to conduct a countrywide exit poll in 1996 also brought exit polls further into the mainstream.
“Without a structured questionnaire, the data can neither be collected coherently nor be analysed systematically to arrive at vote share estimates,” Indian Express quoted Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) director Sanjay Kumar as saying.
What are the rules for exit polls?
Exit polls are governed by The Representation of People Act, 1951.
Section 126 A of the act restricts publication and dissemination of exit polls results.
Advertisement Exit polls are usually conducted right after voters exit the polls on voting day – as opposed to opinion polls which are conducted beforehand. PTI It states, “No person shall conduct any exit poll and publish or publicise by means of the print or electronic media or disseminate in any other manner, whatsoever, the result of any exit poll during such period, as may be notified by the Election Commission in this regard.”
It adds that in case of a general election, the period may commence from the beginning of the hours fixed for the poll on the first day and continue till half an hour after the closing of the poll in all the States and Union territories.
According to Business Standard, this is done so that exit polls don’t influence voters or voting patterns.
Advertisement Those who violate this provision can be sentenced to a prison term of up to two years, a fine or both.
The Election Commission first issued guidelines on exit polls in 1998. The EC under Article 324 of the Constitution barred newspapers and television news channels from publishing or broadcasting results of opinion and exit polls between 5 pm on 14 February 1998 and 5 pm on 7 March 1998. The first phase in that year’s general elections began on 16 February 1998, and the final phase began on 7 March.
As per Economic Times, the EC in 2022 said news broadcasters must not air any final, formal and definite results &ldquo;until such results are formally announced by the Election Commission of India, unless such results are carried with clear disclaimer that they are unofficial or incomplete or partial results or projections which should not be taken as final results.&rdquo;
Advertisement Why are exit polls relevant?
Because people want to know which party and candidates are likely to win &ndash; and quickly.
However, critics say that they are often left wanting when it comes to accuracy.
According to Business Standard, exit polls are also often condemned for being biased, relying on skewed data or improper sample size, and being sponsored or politically motivated. The Economic Times quoted TK Arun as saying, &ldquo;Exit polls are tricky in India. Indians are prudent people. Why would they tell a pollster anything other than what they figure out the pollster wants to hear? Suppose he voted Congress, and says so to the pollster, the BJP wins the election and extracts from pollsters details of all those who said they voted Congress, what mayhem might not follow? Why take the risk? Indians can be rational when the issue at stake is lack of faith as well.&rdquo;
In the past, exit polls have had both hits and misses galore.
According to Hindustan Times, except for the 1998 and 2014 polls, at least four Lok Sabha polls have gotten it badly wrong.
This includes two back-to-back predictions in 2004 and 2009.
The 2004 exit polls in particular were a massive failure with the pollsters completely missing the Congress coming back to power as the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA with its ‘India Shining’ slogan lost its majority.
All exit polls predicted a win for the BJP.
Again in 2009, while most pollsters gave the edge to the UPA, they completely missed a huge swing in its favour.
The UPA added 40 more seats to its tally.
A man looks at a television screen showing exit poll results after the last phase of the general election in Ahmedabad on 19 May 2019. File photo/Reuters In 2014, the BJP won over 330 seats.
While most pollsters said then prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi and the BJP-led NDA would cross the 272 mark, almost none of them forecast the decisive performance.
It was only pollster Chanakya, who predicted 340 seats for the NDA, that came close to getting it spot on.
In 2019, most pollsters predicted that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA government would return &ndash; albeit with a reduced margin compared to the previous election. Of course, we know that the pollsters yet again underestimated the strength of the BJP-led NDA, which would nab 353 seats.

"Predictions, predilections, and Indian general elections",https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/predictions-predilections-and-indian-general-elections-13775669.html,Election predictions are notoriously hard due to the changing nature of the parameters,"Predictions are awfully difficult, even with the reassuring crunch of numbers! And yet, they are our fatal predilection, whether the challenge is for our pleasure or for that of others. Be it the stock market, astrology, or gambling, our insatiable curiosity for the mysterious and unknown is probably what propels such abandonment.
Take the ongoing Lok Sabha polls, going on for perhaps too long now, and the concomitant barrage of prophecies from TV channels, from YouTube “influenczars” and from downright bored individuals, all of whom shoot off their incendiary numbers into the tinder of social media. These soothsayers speak from relative ignorance and mostly from a fascination for a particular party, be they pidis or bhakts.They speak with the confidence that they can actually fool all the people all the time, with Abraham Lincoln being the ultimate fool, poor man. What is most horrendous is that all of them have declared random numbers like 180, 200, 250, 272, 303, 320, 362, 370, and the ace of spades, 400, long before all the votes have come in. This is why I liken election predictions in India to gambling. It is matka guessing in a satta bazar. Parrot talk, or tarot talk, it leads to no concrete outcome. It does not affect the choices made by the voters, choices one suspects were cast in stone, long before the elections were even announced. And yet, these delirious djinns persist, as their minds are made up too. The happy side to this sad fantasy is that it is time-bound, and we can all reclaim our normal lives on June 4.
Advertisement Lighter comments aside, there is a more serious side to prediction, based on the assumption that future events are influenced to some or a greater extent by what has happened before. History is our greatest teacher. The art and science of good prediction lie in identifying which past (or present) event will likely influence an event to come. Let us take the Indian monsoon, an annual event of major economic importance to our nation, and one that has just begun this year. It would help the government enormously if it knew a few months in advance if the monsoon were to be normal, below average, or will punch above its weight.
At present, the Indian monsoon is predicted using a combination of atmospheric models, sea surface temperature analysis, historical data, and satellite observations. Key factors include the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, the Indian Ocean Dipole, and wind patterns. Advanced computational models simulate these variables to forecast rainfall and monsoon onset accurately. However, there are totally different methods of monsoon prediction that would not be considered ‘scientific’ by western definition, but are yet chillingly accurate. Traditionally, some Indian communities predict the monsoon by observing the nesting behaviour of certain birds, like the Indian weaver bird (Baya Weaver). It is believed that if these birds build their nests on higher branches, a heavier monsoon will ensue. Conversely, lower nests indicate lighter rainfall. This method relies on the birds&rsquo; instinctive response to environmental cues, and seems to be largely reliable. Nature lovers might like to correlate this occurrence with the Japanese kō or 72 micro-seasons, for further poetic justification.
Advertisement Prediction is a key aspect of science, and the smaller the number of known events, phenomena, and parameters used to predict a large number of future events accurately, the better the value of the prediction. At the risk of introducing an equation in this column, one can say the value of a prediction, V = (N/n) – 1, where one is able to correctly predict N outcomes with n parameters. According to this equation, the value of a prediction is zero if one needs n parameters to predict N outcomes.
Let’s apply this equation to the present Lok Sabha election. We could say that N = 543, in other words, we want to correctly predict the results from 543 constituencies. How many parameters would we need, or what is the value of n, for a good prediction? What our present-day pollsters are doing, in trying to improve the accuracy of their guesses, is to increase the number of parameters to absurd levels. They ask whether all the Muslim women in Kishanganj will vote like their menfolk, whether the hot summer days in Ramagundam will harm voting, or whether all the Gounders in Kovai will stay loyal to the AIADMK. The problem with such micro-parameters is that they cannot be quantified properly. Informal surveys on the ground may not be the answer because all respondents may not answer truthfully. We see ludicrous statements from politicians—some say that low turnouts hurt the BJP, while others say that low turnouts hurt the Congress. Others say that a low or high turnout may help or hurt a party, depending on the state. Still others say that whatever happens, Congress is winning. The problem with any or all of this is that none of it can be either proven or disproven—this makes it non-scientific. The reader will appreciate that as n increases with all these unprovable parameters, the value of the prediction quickly goes to zero. It is easier to say that there is only one parameter in this election, and that is the prime minister himself. Applying the equation, the value of my prediction is (543/1) – 1 = 542, which in practical terms means a sizable majority for the BJP. I think I’m doing pretty well for myself with this prediction. June 4 will tell.
Advertisement What I would have liked to see, and what seems missing, is a more accurate assessment of ‘swing’ constituencies in bellwether states. No expert needs to predict that the BJP will win in Gandhinagar or that it will lose in South Kolkata. On the other hand, if the BJP were to win in Thiruvananthapuram, Bengaluru Rural, Hyderabad, or Central Chennai, this would signify that winds of change are blowing across the country. The very high voter turnout in Baramulla is another pointer. An ability to extrapolate from this to an accurate prediction about the Kashmir Valley in particular and the country in general, is what is missing. Once again, what I would like to see on June 4 is how soon any particular TV channel is able to call the election, say by 9, 10, or 11 am? The sooner it is able to do this, the better its reports will be and the less fluff and bluff.
Advertisement Election predictions are notoriously hard due to the changing nature of the parameters, something we do not usually see in science. The Truman-Dewey US presidential election of 1945, was made memorable by the photograph of the victor, Harry Truman, brandishing a copy of the Chicago Tribune that screamed the wrong headline, “Dewey defeats Truman”. So close was the vote. At the end of World War II, the UK voted against Winston Churchill, their doughty PM, who had saved them from Nazi tyranny. He was hustled out of office when the Labour Party won by a substantial majority. Can we ever imagine a similar situation in India? And yet, some of our own elections have indeed yielded surprising results, and one recollects 1971, 1977, and 2019, when the decisiveness of the mandate was quite something else.

Beyond the Lines | Indian elections: What the biggest show on earth can teach the world,https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/beyond-the-lines-indian-elections-what-the-biggest-show-on-earth-can-teach-the-world-13773225.html,"Not only are the Indian general elections the largest poll show on earth — they are also the most intensely contested and certainly, sets the bar for America to follow this November","This was going to be the global election year that decides the fate of the world. This was also going to be the biggest election in the world’s biggest democracy. With over 900 million broadband subscribers, the Indian voter is more plugged into the commentary of the voting analysis, trends and outcomes.
The cacophony of election analysis is hardwired into the heads of Indian citizens through their phones and devices, their choices dictated by opinions and beliefs, which in turn has been an outcome of results seen in the last five years. Yet, when I went to cast my vote this Monday, the booth-level machinery was so well-oiled and efficient that beyond the cacophony of election sloganeering and digital pyrotechnics, the unassuming power of silent citizens dutifully stepping up to vote on their appointed day, sans drama or hyperbole, held up a useful guide for the rest of the world to emulate.
Advertisement India, the world’s most populous democracy, is currently holding its general election over a seven-phase period that continues for seven weeks. Indians can vote between 19 April and 1 June, with the results set to be declared on 4 June.
The World Decides in 2024
Over fifty elections take place in 2024, including some of the most impacting ones such as the US, Russia, India, Taiwan. Fifty-one per cent of the world will either have a new dispensation or continue with the existing one. As elections take place across the world, the festival of democracy in India is expected to be among the keenly contested, fair and well organised ones in the world.
These elections have also proved that India sets consistent standards in choosing their leaders, disproving a biased opinion about democracy and elections that certain western thinking has held towards India. Using a template of a fairness score to evaluate the independence of elections in countries, as a well-known western publication recently did, reduces the process of choices in elections to a rating number which can both end up being biased and patronising, and is dictated by a long-held expectation that Indian polls are simultaneously cantankerous and exotic — a work in progress democracy that promises to be civilised but is never one. It also served to quietly aid a narrative that the democratic processes in the west are superior.
Advertisement Why India’s Free Elections Trumps West’s Bias
Take for instance, the freedom and fairness score accorded to India’s elections, which is 0.53 and compare it to the other nations in their leadup to the elections. Mexico is a country heading for elections this year. In this election cycle, 30 candidates have already been assassinated, according to data from the research firm Laboratorio Electoral. In 2021, 30 candidates were killed while in 2018, the elections saw 24 killings. These elections are expected to be among the most violent. According to western pundits, Mexico has a freedom and fairness score of 0.75 in the conduct of elections, which indicates the elections are more ‘just and fair’ than in India. Parts of western media has been unduly harsh on India, rating its fairness score of elections at 0.53.
Advertisement In Indonesia, the electoral process is still dominated by corrupt or influential leaders who grew powerful during the authoritarian rule of Suharto. Democracy is new, and power oscillated between influential stakeholders, till Joko Widodo, an outsider, broke the stranglehold. Thereafter, a general took over as President — one the west has accused of human rights abuses. Interestingly, Indonesia’s freedom and fairness score stands at 0.68, higher than India. Which means that the credibility of Indian elections is just about better than the banana republics — an assumption that betrays the negative bias of such studies.
The US, rated high in freedom and fairness index by the publication, struggled under serious allegations of tampering and influence by Russia and the subsequent response of Trump supporters laying siege in Washington DC after losing the elections indicated a democracy that was functional but not civilised. On the other hand, far from the history of some of the nations, who have either embraced dysfunctional democracy along the way or seem to be falling by the wayside in terms of their law and order situation in the lead up to the elections, India has maintained an enviable record of holding free and fair elections over seven decades.
Advertisement The Decisive Indian Vote
From the general election held in 1951-52 in which 17.5 crore Indians, voted in the elections to the 18th Lok Sabha that are under way, the process has evolved and matured along with Indian democracy over the decades. So have the voters graduated, from being largely illiterate to being well informed and technically savvy while making choices.
The CEC explained why the voluntary nature of casting votes means that the ECI operates ‘in an entirely persuasive space, inviting the citizens to volunteer to become part of the electoral roll and, thereafter, through systematic voter awareness programmes, motivates them to exercise their franchise.’ There is a high elector to population ratio which underpins the discipline, patience and belief that Indian voters have demonstrated in executing the process. The power of Indian elections demonstrates a growing, emerging India that is willing and ready to show how democracy is a proven political system in this world. Take for instance the example of Jammu and Kashmir.
Advertisement Since 1989, all earlier elections in the region had been plagued by violence and a tendence towards anarchy, influenced by separatist parties. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Anantnag, Srinagar and Baramulla — the Lok Sabha seats — recorded dismal attendance.
Baramulla recorded 46 per cent voting in 1996. Thereafter it has struggled to have voters on election days. Twenty-eight years later, 59 per cent of Baramulla showed up to vote on polling day, breaking the previous record.
This time, local political leaders have addressed large crowds who are keen to be a part of the time-tested process of democracy and express their opinions at the poll booths, unlike earlier times when boycotts dominated Kashmiri elections and the turnout, cowed down by the gun, often struggled to crawl out of single digit percentage attendance.
The resolve to bring Kashmir out of a rut of decades-old militancy by taking the gun out of the equation has helped locals trust the power of the ballot in making lives better instead of being ruled by fear of militancy. There is a growing curiosity about the choices available in a democracy through the power of the ballot, which many people in the state now see value in, unlike across the border where democracy is in shambles and offers no choices.
Younger India: 18 Million First-Time Voters
One of the key aspects in these elections is the addition of over 2-crore young first time voters. These voters, in each successive edition, are going to boost a voting population that consumes digital information and has a strong sense of independent opinion. A keen interest among young voters has led to parties canvassing through digital platforms. An increasingly politically conscious, intelligent but less patient voter base has meant that parties have had to address more matured issues – which also tells us how India has travelled a fair distance from the days when Garibi Hatao was a dominating slogan.
The voter turnout, lower in the early stages, yet reflects an involved participation of its citizens across the country. In a country where different belief systems have held sway, the one common space where India comes together as a country is its general election. Which is why, an election season resembles a festival of choices rather than a mere mechanical process of choosing.
India Votes for the World to Emulate
In the previous national edition in 2019, the Election Commission confirmed a 67 per cent turnout. The Americans were marginally higher in the same period while voting in their elections. The Indian elections have also been among the most expensive elections, in which political parties spent more than 7 billion in 2019, higher than the spends in the US elections in that period. Not only are the Indian general elections the largest poll show on earth — they are also the most intensely contested and certainly, sets the bar for America to follow this November.
While wars and conflicts singe the world in most parts and certain nations have gone berserk losing their way while making choices, India proves yet again that this election festival of citizens is not only the biggest but also the most civilised and sane process on earth.

"Busy dousing fire on Swati Maliwal 'assault' row, AAP loses a week of Kejriwal's freedom and fought against itself than rivals",https://www.firstpost.com/india/busy-dousing-fire-on-swati-maliwal-assault-row-aap-loses-a-week-of-kejriwals-freedom-and-fought-against-itself-than-rivals-13772369.html,"Amid the escalating blame game, the focus abruptly moved from Arvind Kejriwal to Swati Maliwal and the internal feud between Maliwal and other AAP members overshadowed Kejriwal&rsquo;s continuous attacks on the prime minister and the BJP","When the Supreme Court granted interim bail to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on 10 May until 2 June, the AAP leader had a clear agenda ahead. Arrested on 21 March by the Enforcement Directorate in the liquor policy case, Kejriwal now had 21 days to capitalise on his temporary release. His primary focus would have been to generate publicity for himself and the AAP by intensifying his criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP.
Advertisement The Maliwal incident: A shift in focus
This situation progressed smoothly until the Swati Maliwal incident on 13 May. On that day, AAP Rajya Sabha MP Swati Maliwal accused Bibhav Kumar, a member of Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal&rsquo;s personal staff of misconduct. Following her allegations, the Delhi Police arrested Kejriwal&rsquo;s private assistant Bibhav Kumar, igniting a dual conflict: AAP versus BJP and Swati Maliwal versus the rest of AAP.
Amid the escalating blame game, two significant shifts occurred. First, the focus abruptly moved from Arvind Kejriwal to Swati Maliwal. Second, the internal feud between Maliwal and other AAP members overshadowed Kejriwal&rsquo;s continuous attacks on the prime minister and the BJP.
Significantly, this incident consumed a crucial portion of Kejriwal&rsquo;s 21 days of freedom with an entire week diverted to the Maliwal controversy.
Strategic reorientation
Regardless of whether AAP inadvertently fell into a trap or recognised the situation belatedly, Kejriwal understood the pressing need to redirect attention back to himself. He needed to refocus the battle onto BJP territory and distance the party from the Maliwal incident. Whether it was genuine support for his long-time aide Kumar or a strategy to revitalise AAP, the Delhi chief minister knew that a significant move was necessary to reclaim the spotlight.
What better way to do it than challenge Prime Minister Modi to arrest all AAP leaders as he announced on Saturday that he would march to BJP headquarters in Delhi on Sunday at noon accompanied by all the prominent leaders of his party. More the chaos better the publicity.
Advertisement Kejriwal alleged that the BJP was trying to completely destroy AAP through Operation Jhadu. He shared that people who were familiar with both the BJP and him had informed him that Prime Minister Modi acknowledged AAP&rsquo;s growing influence and the global discussion around their work. Kejriwal said that the BJP saw AAP as a potential tough challenger in several states and wanted to eliminate them. He made these statements while addressing the press at the party office on Sunday.
Importance of Delhi for AAP
Voting for all seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi is scheduled for 25 May as part of Phase 6 of the polling.
Advertisement Delhi is of paramount importance to the AAP for several reasons. It is the party&rsquo;s primary base and stronghold where it was founded and first achieved significant political success by winning the Delhi Legislative Assembly elections in 2013. Maintaining control over Delhi is essential for AAP&rsquo;s political legitimacy and influence. Furthermore, Delhi serves as a showcase for AAP&rsquo;s governance model and policies.
AAP finds itself grappling with the challenge of maintaining a focussed engagement with its diverse electorate in Delhi, which encompasses various socioeconomic groups. Amid its efforts to highlight flagship programmes such as mohalla clinics, subsidised electricity and its work in government schools, the controversy surrounding Maliwal has diverted public attention from these areas which AAP would have wanted to bring in front of the voters.
Advertisement Whether the Maliwal incident is indeed a premeditated attack on AAP as the party alleges or simply a coincidence only time will reveal. However, there is no doubt that it has placed AAP in a defensive position precisely when it was gearing up for a strong offensive. Whether it&rsquo;s a calculated move by a political mastermind or just an unfortunate stroke of fate remains uncertain for now.

How Swati Maliwal row is disrupting Arvind Kejriwal’s campaign for Lok Sabha polls,https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/swati-maliwal-row-arvind-kejriwal-13772041.html,"While Arvind Kejriwal&rsquo;s release from jail to campaign for the Lok Sabha polls came as a big relief to the AAP and the Opposition, the Swati Maliwal controversy has cast a pall over proceedings. While the Delhi chief minister has remained mum over the matter, the party has claimed that there is a &lsquo;BJP conspiracy&rsquo; to frame him","Arvind Kejriwal must have felt great relief when he was granted bail by the Supreme Court.
The apex court granted the Delhi chief minister bail in the alleged money laundering case in order to campaign for the Lok Sabha polls.
But the controversy over Swati Maliwal has dogged Kejriwal at every step.
Maliwal, the AAP&rsquo;s Rajya Sabha MP, filed an FIR on Thursday accusing the Delhi chief minister&rsquo;s aide Bibhav Kumar of assaulting her. Advertisement The AAP has alleged a conspiracy is being hatched against Kejriwal, while the BJP has demanded stringent action against the accused.
Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at how the row has disrupted his campaign:
Kejriwal&rsquo;s release from jail was a big boost to the party and the Opposition.
The Times of India quoted Sandeep Pathak, a close aide of Kejriwal who is overseeing the AAP Lok Sabha campaign, as saying the development breathed fresh life into the party.
&ldquo;With him, the cadre feels happier, much more positive, much more charged. That’s one aspect of it. The other is that the BJP thought that they would get Kejriwal arrested and then start breaking up the AAP in Delhi and Punjab. But they miserably failed,&rdquo; the AAP Rajya Sabha MP said.
But Maliwal&rsquo;s accusations have now cast a pall over proceedings.
&ldquo;While the whole truth is not out yet, all is certainly not well inside the AAP. There have been reports of differences between Kejriwal and Maliwal for some time. There are claims that Kejriwal was not happy with Maliwal&rsquo;s absence from Delhi before and after his arrest as well as her relative silence on his arrest. Maliwal, however, was reportedly visiting her sister in the US,&rdquo; the piece stated.
It noted that if Kejriwal is sent to jail again for a long time, the party is likely to fracture. But if he is granted regular bail, he will likely be able to keep his team together.
&ldquo;What was supposed to be a few weeks of respite for Kejriwal are proving to be a testing period. His attention will now be divided between the election campaign and the party affairs,&rdquo; the piece noted.
Advertisement On Wednesday some people also raised slogans during Kejriwal&rsquo;s road show in Chandni Chowk against Kumar, as per The Times of India.
&lsquo;Slapped, hit in stomach&rsquo;
Maliwal in her FIR filed Thursday claimed she was &ldquo;slapped, hit in the stomach and kicked&rdquo; by Kumar.
The FIR was registered after Maliwal&rsquo;s statement was recorded by a two-member team led by Additional Commissioner of Police P.S. Kushwaha.
The team was at Maliwal&rsquo;s residence in central Delhi for nearly four and a half hours.
AAP Rajya Sabha MP Swati Maliwal has accused Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal&rsquo;s aide of assault. PTI File Photo Maliwal claimed she ran out of the CM&rsquo;s residence and called the police immediately after the incident.
Kejriwal was present at his residence when the incident took place, she added.
Advertisement Maliwal broke down several times while giving the statement and sought strict action against Kumar.
The AAP MP on Thursday underwent medical check-up at All India Institute of Medical Sciences.
Kejriwal evades question, BJP attacks
Adding fuel to the fire, Kejriwal on Wednesday did not address Maliwal&rsquo;s allegations during a press conference.
Kejriwal, flanked by Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav and AAP Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh, evaded a question on the subject.
Singh, however, said his party has already made its stand clear on the issue.
#WATCH | Lucknow, UP: On AAP Rajya Sabha MP Swati Maliwal&#39;s assault case, AAP MP Sanjay Singh says &quot;The entire country was in pain after seeing what happened in Manipur but PM Modi was silent on the issue. Prajwal Revanna raped thousands of women but PM Modi was asking for votes… pic.twitter.com/nQu73jcqNQ
&mdash; ANI (@ANI) May 16, 2024 Advertisement Singh, who had met Maliwal at her residence on Wednesday, said, &ldquo;The AAP is our family. Party has made its view clear.&rdquo;
He also targeted the BJP government at the Centre by raising the issue of a Manipuri woman being paraded naked, the Prajwal Revanna sex scandal and Maliwal being &ldquo;beaten up&rdquo; by police during protests by wrestlers when she was the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) chief.
Advertisement &ldquo;I want that BJP and PM should also answer on the issues I have kept before you. He (PM) should answer on the issue of Swati Maliwal, who was dragged and beaten when she went to seek justice for the female wrestlers. I just want to say don&rsquo;t play political games on the issues,&rdquo; he said.
Yadav then took the microphone and said &ldquo;there are more important things than that&rdquo;.
Then, unfolding a piece of paper, he added, &ldquo;BJP people are not with anyone, it is a &lsquo;gang&rsquo; that lodges false cases&rdquo;.
Singh at a press conference on Tuesday had accepted that Kumar had &ldquo;misbehaved&rdquo; with Maliwal.
He also labelled the incident &lsquo;highly condemnable&rsquo;, as per The Times of India.
BJP national spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia claimed that Kejriwal is the main &ldquo;criminal&rdquo; in the complaint that his aide Kumar had physically attacked Maliwal at the chief minister&rsquo;s residence, as he cited the telephone call she had made to the Delhi Police to report the matter.
&ldquo;His (Kejriwal) silence speaks a lot. Out of jail, he is more a &lsquo;goonda&rsquo; than a chief minister,&rdquo; he told reporters, noting that Kumar was seen with the chief minister in Lucknow.
Stringent action should be taken against the accused in the case, he said.
Kumar, he noted, was photographed with Kejriwal during his visit to Lucknow.
On Friday, the Delhi BJP Mahila Morcha members staged a protest near Kejriwal&rsquo;s residence.
Led by Mahila Morcha president Richa Pandey Mishra, the protesters, who were carrying bangles, demanded Kejriwal&rsquo;s resignation.
Mishra said the Mahila Morcha wanted to hand over the bangles to Kejriwal for keeping mum over the incident with Maliwal that occurred at his official residence.
“Arvind Kejriwal should be ashamed. He should resign from his post and apologise to the country. Swati Maliwal should get justice,&quot; a Mahila Morcha member told PTI.
The Mahila Morcha of the Delhi BJP also extended support to Maliwal, writing a letter to her saying the incident was a matter of honour of women in the country.
A team of the Delhi Police also turned up at Kejriwal&rsquo;s residence on Friday, as per India Today.
&lsquo;BJP conspiracy to frame Kejirwal&rsquo;
Meanwhile, the AAP has claimed the case is a &lsquo;BJP conspiracy to frame Kejriwal.&rsquo;
Senior AAP leader Atishi at a press conference said, &ldquo;Today a video has surfaced that has exposed the lie of Maliwal. In her FIR, she has said she was brutally assaulted and she was in pain, and buttons of her shirt were torn. A video that has surfaced shows an entirely different reality.&rdquo;
Atishi said the video shows Maliwal &ldquo;comfortably sitting in the drawing room&rdquo; and &ldquo;threatening the security staff&rdquo;, and that &ldquo;her clothes were not torn&rdquo;.
&ldquo;The video shows her threatening Kumar. The charges levelled by Maliwal are baseless. Maliwal insisted on meeting Kejriwal. She is Rajya Sabha MP and she should know that the CM has a busy schedule. Kumar told her that the chief minister is busy and unable to meet her. She shouted at him, pushed him and tried to enter the residential portion of the CM House,&rdquo; she claimed.
&ldquo;The whole incident proves that it was a BJP conspiracy and Swati Maliwal was made its face to frame Kejriwal,&rdquo; she alleged.
Asked about Singh accepting misbehaviour with Maliwal, Atishi said, &ldquo;AAP MP Sanjay Singh met Maliwal and he had only her version. But now this video has brought out the truth.&rdquo;
